1,If you remember this then you deserve a veterans discount ||| Only REAL veterans are the ones who remember this when it was Arena 7 ,Only REAL veterans are the ones who remember when there was no Legendary Arena ,SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response continues the same pattern established in Comment 2 by making a claim about 'REAL veterans' based on remembering an even earlier game state (before Legendary Arena existed). This is a straightforward escalation of the gatekeeping joke rather than sarcastic reversal, using the same sincere-sounding gatekeeping format to one-up the previous comment."
2,"Baby Yoda and The Dark Crystal Prove We Still Need Puppetry in the Age of CGI ||| We even have better tech to get some amazing animatronic movements. There's so much potential for practical effects. ||| Still sad about how much better *The Thing* (2011) could have been [if they went with animatronics instead](<URL> ||| Fun fact... most of those effects were complete and filmed. The studio forced them to cover the effects with cgi because its ""what audiences would want. """,How can studios be so completely tone deaf?,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,88,The response is a genuine rhetorical question expressing sincere frustration about studio decisions to replace practical effects with CGI despite audience preference for practical effects. The tone aligns with the critical sentiment established in the thread without irony or feigned meaning.
3,"What are some huge GREEN flags that are often overlooked? ||| People doing kind or generous things they don’t expect praise for, like secret gifts or acts of service.","And you learn about these secret gifts how, exactly?",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses rhetorical questioning with an ironic tone to mock the logical contradiction in Comment 2's suggestion—if gifts are truly secret, how would you ever discover them as a green flag? The questioner is pointing out this flaw through feigned confusion rather than genuine inquiry."
4,"Whistleblower who escaped Chinese re-education camp reveals horrors of the gulag: Ex-teacher tells how inmates were flayed, raped by guards in front of other prisoners, and given injections that made them infertile ||| I think you're just uneducated on the situation. ","Yeah, we wouldn't want to hurt the feelings of the poor party members who are in control! ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggerated irony to mock Comment 2's dismissal of serious human rights abuses. By sarcastically suggesting concern for 'party members' feelings, the speaker is ridiculing the implication that criticism of atrocities should be softened or reconsidered."
5,Postgame Thread Arizona State Defeats Oregon 31-28 ||| I can't decide if ESPN is sad that their 6v7 matchup is ruined or happy that they don't have to pretend to care about the Pac 12 anymore lol ||| They can now just push more SEC teams into the playoff. Especially after Alabama's big win over WCU,"I'd be fine with LSU, Alabama, Georgia, Florida in the CFP. I don't see anything wrong with that. #itjustmeansmore ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response sarcastically suggests putting four SEC teams (all from the same conference) in the College Football Playoff as if it's reasonable, while the hashtag #itjustmeansmore mockingly echoes the SEC's promotional slogan. This is clearly mocking the bias toward SEC teams in playoff selection, which aligns with the thread's criticism of ESPN favoring SEC coverage."
6,"Dog saves woman from getting robbed ||| If that dog isnt hers....i hope she took it home after that, it deserves it ||| Steal someone else's dog?",It's not stealing if he follows you home... Where you make fliers that you'll never put up because dog is chill. Sort of ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses ironic humor to describe a scenario of essentially stealing a dog while pretending it's not theft ('it's not stealing if he follows you home'). The exaggerated detail about making fliers 'that you'll never put up' sarcastically mocks the self-aware rationalization someone might use to justify keeping someone else's dog.
7,"Australia votes yes to legalise Same Sex Marriage ||| Overwhelming result. Every state and territory voted Yes by a clear majority. 133 of 150 electorates voted Yes. Survey was 61.3%, Newspoll had it at 63%, so $100 million and great stress to LGBTI people to tell Australia what we already knew. Now get it done, you goddamned idiots.",But the polling is wrong because people lie about how they voted. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,75,"The response contradicts the concrete empirical evidence presented in Comment 2 (actual survey results of 61.3% and Newspoll at 63%) by claiming 'polling is wrong because people lie.' This dismissal of objective data through an unsubstantiated claim appears to be sarcastic pushback against the clear pro-marriage equality result, mocking the notion that hidden opposition would invalidate the overwhelming democratic mandate."
8,"My kid’s fake cash register has fake inputs on the back. ||| Great, now you have to buy some fake cables. What a money grab ||| That's how they get ya. Edit: Thanks for the gold... but... why?! ||| Then you gotta add on the extended warranty",it's fine to pay with Google Play cards tho,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,75,"The response sarcastically suggests paying with Google Play cards for a children's toy cash register, which is absurd and continues the thread's pattern of mocking unnecessary purchases and fees. The absurdity of the suggestion combined with the casual tone implies the opposite of what is stated—it's clearly not fine and not a real solution."
9,"Discussion This subreddit is downvote cancer. ||| Too many people refuse to negotiate and simply downvote when they don't like an offer. Low are part of a market. Be a part of the solution! Upvote for anything respectable. Be kind to thy fellow trader. ||| Hush, you still think Pluto is a planet. ||| Lmao dammit u/NCJoe97, as soon as I don't see you for awhile you pop up and tell everyone my secret!",I like to hide and wait for my turn to talk :P What better moment than to spill some beans?,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response is a playful, lighthearted admission that uses self-deprecating humor and a winky emoticon to acknowledge being called out for revealing secrets. The speaker is genuinely playing along with the joke rather than saying the opposite of what they mean or using irony."
10,"TIL Canada has a failsafe to prevent a USA like government shutdown. If the Parliament cant agree, an election is triggered, potentially replacing many representatives ||| Prorogued, being latin for ""Technical Difficulties, Please Stand By"".",The Rick Mercer report was a great show,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,78,"The response appears to reference Rick Mercer, a Canadian political satirist who frequently mocked Canadian politics and government dysfunction. In the context of discussing Canadian parliamentary procedures and prorogation, this seems to be an oblique, sarcastic reference to how Mercer would have satirized such political issues, rather than a genuine compliment about the show itself."
11,I guess he just doesn’t like the word. ||| Expand our vocabulary by getting rid of a word? Flawless. ||| They obviously meant expanding the length of the words because long words make you smart.,Be sure to long words into your sentences to sound smart.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses intentionally awkward grammar ('long words into your sentences') to mock the idea that using unnecessarily long words makes you sound smart, continuing the sarcastic tone established in Comment 3. The deliberate grammatical error serves as ironic evidence that mindlessly inserting long words actually makes communication worse, not better."
12,"Fox and friends anchors wide-eyed as fellow anchor talks about how races should not be interbreeding ||| That was so out of no where. Those two other anchors were just making banter about some fluff piece and this guy had to suddenly shift to ""people shouldn't marry outside their ethnic group"".",Then the other two tried to save the train wreck but ended up just dumbfounded,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response uses figurative language ('save the train wreck') but is describing a genuine awkward situation straightforwardly—the anchors actually were dumbfounded by the inappropriate comment. This is hyperbolic description rather than sarcasm, as the literal meaning aligns with the actual events being discussed."
13,"The lack of Net Neutrality could eventually lead to us not being able to go to certain sneaker-realted websites, not being able to watch our favorite content creators, and quite possibly not use this subreddit. Find your representative today. (Repost per mod’s request) ||| Imagine having to pay to access yeezysupply at a normal speed 😫 ||| Yeah, you might take the time to consider your terrible spending decisions.","Terrible or not, that dude got yeezys ",SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response is a straightforward, somewhat humorous acknowledgment that despite questionable spending habits, the person still managed to acquire Yeezys. It's making a light joke rather than saying the opposite of what is meant or using irony."
14,1950s She sure was ahead of her times. ||| And her eyes were closed. ||| She didn’t see race. Thank you ladies and gentlemen...I’m out.,"To be fair though, everything was black and white back then...",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses a double meaning of 'black and white' (literal photography/film vs. racial context) to mock the previous joke about not 'seeing race.' The feigned earnest tone ('To be fair though') combined with the clever wordplay that deflates the punchline of Comment 3 indicates sarcastic intent.
15,"This is what were doing to the ocean ||| The biggest issue LIKELY isn't the big examples of plastic here, but the ""microplastics"" that are tiny bits of plastic that can be manufactured (like the ones in exfoliating facial washes) or originate from larger pieces like seen here that degrade into them. Research is still being performed to determine their actual impact, but it is believed they are significantly more harmful than these large pieces. (maybe because it's much more difficult to see and clean up? And marine life can more easily interact with them in a bad way? I don't know for sure)","To add to this, fleece has basically the same effect after every wash.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a genuine, informative addition to the discussion about microplastics. It straightforwardly states a factual concern about fleece clothing shedding microfibers when washed, which is a well-documented environmental issue that directly relates to the thread's topic. There is no irony, exaggeration, or contradictory tone present."
16,"You do you, Seattle. ||| ITT: People who have never played with a football. Balls deform when you are kicking them as hard as you can.... ||| This thing I'd made out of metal. URL",Obviously that's a piece of rubber and not made from brass. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses ironic exaggeration by claiming the object is 'obviously' rubber when Comment 3 explicitly states it's made of metal. The speaker is sarcastically contradicting the established fact to mock or dismiss the claim about the football being made of metal.
17,"People who downloaded their Google data and went through it, what were the most unsettling things you found out they had stored about you? ||| That there is a map of everywhere I went in the last couple of years that's accurate to the hour. ||| Google Maps > Your Timeline ||| According to this, I once walked 650 miles in 11 minutes.",How else you gonna walk 500 miles and walk 500 more just to fall down at her door,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a reference to the song 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' by The Proclaimers, making a humorous connection to Comment 4's absurd claim of walking 650 miles in 11 minutes. It's a joke/pun rather than sarcasm, as the commenter is genuinely playing on the literal lyrics to make light of the impossible distance mentioned."
18,Bernie Sanders hitting a single at Iowa’s Field of Dreams! ||| You'd have thought he'd have hit it to left field. ||| He hit it to all fields. ||| The pull-side 1% of the field gets 90% of the hits in today's game... Simply not fair. He's showing us how to distribute our hits like he'll distribute healthcare.,> He's showing us how to distribute our hits Bernie Sanders hates the shift confirmed,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response mockingly takes Comment 4's critique about hit distribution and absurdly concludes that Bernie Sanders 'hates the shift' - a baseball defensive strategy completely unrelated to the wealth inequality metaphor being made. This exaggerated, illogical leap is used to ridicule the political analogy in the previous comment."
19,McDavid with penalty shot of the year candidate. ||| Show this to young players tbh. Let them know that even the best in the world make simple mistakes.,That's because McDavid isn't ready for the NHL... ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The statement claims McDavid 'isn't ready for the NHL' which is absurdly false given he's one of the best players in the world, making the comment clearly ironic. The sarcasm is used to mock the notion that a single mistake indicates unreadiness, reinforcing the previous comment's point that even elite players make errors."
20,Princess and Musketeer in Anime Style ||| The princess is my new waifu thank u sir. I print her face on my anime body pillow. (Joke),This is somehow more cring than people who use ,SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response appears to be an incomplete genuine criticism comparing the cringe level of the previous comment to something else. The tone is straightforward disapproval rather than ironic or feigned, though the response is cut off mid-sentence making full analysis difficult."
21,Illumix is the best company on this planet ||| This confirms sex is canon to FNaF.,"might put a dampener on the whole ""Michael looks pretty much exactly like William bc William reproduced via mitosis"" theory",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is making a literal, humorous observation about how the confirmation of sexual reproduction in FNaF canon contradicts a fan theory about Michael and William's appearance. It's using wit and irony in the absurdist humor of the theory itself, but the statement is not sarcastic—it's a genuine commentary on the logical implications of the canon confirmation."
22,Wanda: I lost everything. Also Wanda: ||| Most of the CGI budget was spent on removing Vision’s bulge. ||| I demand a director's cut with Vision's bulge left intact. And every other hero's as well. They could call it *Avengers: The Complete Package.* ||| Ryan Reynolds is making ten different phone calls right now.,"I mean, if anyone could it’d be him.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a genuine agreement with the previous comment that Ryan Reynolds (known for his comedic, irreverent humor) would be the type of person to make such an audacious director's cut. It's not saying the opposite of what is meant or employing irony; it's straightforward agreement."
23,"TIL: This year, the official Yu Gi Oh tournament hosted by Konami instituted a hygiene clause to rulebook. This allows judges to penalize players with dirty clothing or terrible odor by giving them a loss. Super Smash Bros tournament have also started implementing similar rules. ||| Big business opportunity. Anime deodorant and soap that makes you smell like your favorite character. It'd sell out at these and make everyone's life easier.",That's a collectible item! You can't use those! They need to stay in the package or they lose their value!! Filthy casual ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggeration and ironic logic to mock collectors who keep items in packages. By suggesting the anime deodorant/soap should be kept unused to preserve value (contradicting the original idea to use them for hygiene), it's sarcastically critiquing obsessive collectible culture while calling the commenter a 'filthy casual' in a joking manner."
24,"reposted cuz removed ||| Hot Take: I can't stand Jerma ' TF2 content, but I regularly watch his current Twitch streams ||| I think i get that, he isn't very good at tf2 at all, but he's just a very funny guy when he's doing basically anything.",But guys what about “sphee” haha remember “sphee” guys come on it’s funny haha ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggerated repetition ('haha' repeated, 'guys' repeated, 'come on') and forced enthusiasm to mock an outdated or weak joke reference ('sphee'), implying that the joke isn't actually funny despite claiming it is. This appears to be sarcastic criticism of Jerma's older content humor."
25,"Bugatti hits 304.77mph in a Chiron ||| The [rear] looks so much better than the normal car ||| Shotgun exhaust, nice. I always think of the Datsun 270Z when I see one. ||| I think you mean 240, 260, or 280z.","No, he meant 270Z. He knows something we don’t. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses feigned agreement and exaggeration ('He knows something we don't') to mock Comment 3's factual error about the Datsun model name. The tone is clearly ironic, as the responder knows the 270Z doesn't exist and is sarcastically suggesting the original commenter has secret knowledge to ridicule their mistake."
26,Tesla Turns Power Back On At Childrens Hospital In Puerto Rico ||| You don't see Edison doing that. ||| He would electrocute Puerto Rico to demonstrate what happens when you use Tesla.,"<URL> ""They'll say 'Awww, Topsy' at my auuuuuutopsy...""",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a direct quote from the historical 'Topsy' incident where Thomas Edison electrocuted an elephant in 1903 to demonstrate the dangers of Tesla's AC current. The user is providing a darkly humorous historical reference that supports Comment 3's point about Edison electrocuting things, not employing sarcasm but rather making a literal joke based on actual history."
27,"""Manspreading"" has found its match in what I call ""Bagspreading"" ||| She is doing it on purpose... sitting sideways with her bag there. It's easy.. just go up and ask her to move her bag. Then watch as she flips out for no reason...might throw a cat at you... ||| Oh, it is totally an offensive move. She has created an environment there for herself that she is actively barricading. This type of person needs to be ""checked"" publicly for a couple of reasons. 1) to show other people that it IS ok to address social BS like this 2) show people that do this that it is not ok and it might be called out 3) seats are for asses, not purses. If she wants to play cuddle knee, cool, i might start picking my nose and wiping it on my jeans tho. ;)",How else can she protect herself from getting raped by you? ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggeration and irony to mock the previous commenter's aggressive suggestions about 'checking' a woman for taking up space with her bag. By sarcastically suggesting the woman needs protection from sexual assault, the responder is ridiculing the commenter's hostile framing and implied threat (picking his nose/wiping on jeans), turning their aggressive stance back on them."
28,"OP lost son at age of 15. redditor gives him advice. ||| That same user later added: ""Are we seriously going to let someone karma whore their theoretical dead gay son?"" Hot damn. ||| Homeboy didn't just double down. Fucker went and trumped.",Did you just say trump? You gotta be a Hillary shill. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,75,"The response uses exaggerated logic and mock accusation to ridicule the previous commenter's use of the word 'trump' (meaning to surpass/exceed). By absurdly equating the use of the word 'trump' with being a 'Hillary shill,' the responder is sarcastically mocking political tribalism and the tendency to interpret innocent language through a partisan lens."
29,"Reaction of every reasonable player ||| oh nice they're going to finally remove premium ammo! Can't wait! ||| Yea its so great, cant imagine how we r gonna pen a type 5 now ||| The obvious solution would be giving the Japanese and russian heavies weak spots",But that sould hurt the realism of the game. They dont have weak spots irl too. They are perfect. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,The response uses feigned agreement and exaggeration to mock the claim that removing weak spots maintains realism. The statement that tanks 'are perfect' and 'dont have weak spots irl' is clearly false and meant ironically to ridicule the previous commenter's logic.
30,"If this post reaches 2000 upskys. this subreddit will become a Mr Robot sub in support of Hello Games binge ||| ""I admit that I was there in the beginning for drama""...thanks for confirming my suspicions Barky. You are indeed, a perfect mod for this place. Can this be classed as self-advertising if you're linking to your own YouTube channel? ||| Uh, Barky didn't make this post. ||| I know ""he"" didn't, but you obviously talked about it right, got his approval?",They had to get Sean's approval first. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses ironic exaggeration to mock the accusation that approval was needed, suggesting that getting Sean Murray's (Hello Games creator) approval would be even more absurd than getting a mod's approval. It's feigned agreement that amplifies the ridiculousness of the implied conspiracy theory being discussed."
31,When you go from silver to global in 1 sec ||| Relatable until you got the kills,Yeah he didn't get one tapped by the dude that missed and entire mag on his teammate,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses ironic exaggeration to mock the unrealistic scenario in the original post. By describing an absurd situation (missing an entire magazine but still getting kills), the speaker is sarcastically pointing out the improbability of the silver-to-global rank jump, which contradicts the earlier comment about it being 'relatable.'"
32,"One Million People Demand Trump’s Tax Return, Smashing Petition Record ||| Official response from the White House: ""nah"" ||| or ""the media made that up, no one wants to see those returns"" or ""that petition is only signed by illegal immigrants""","He claimed 3 million illegal immigrants voted against him, so this is just a drop in the bucket",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggeration and irony to mock Trump's tendency to make unsubstantiated claims about illegal voters. By treating the 1 million petition signatures as insignificant compared to the fabricated 3 million illegal voters claim, the speaker is sarcastically highlighting the absurdity and hypocrisy of dismissing legitimate petitions while promoting baseless voter fraud claims."
33,"My dog destroyed her toy cactus, and there was another sad cactus inside ||| Inside every happy cactus is a sad cactus waiting to come out. ||| but on the outside, cacti are mostly pricks.",I'd make an excellent cactus. Missed my calling.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The speaker is making a self-deprecating joke by claiming they would make an excellent cactus because, as established in the previous comment, cacti are 'mostly pricks.' They're sarcastically suggesting they are prickly/difficult in personality, using ironic self-awareness to continue the humorous cactus pun thread."
34,"""Tell the Prime Minister to go and get f*ed"" - Firefighter from Nelligen, NSW ||| He was probably just tired - Scummo. ||| He's probably just pissed he missed the cricket- Scummo","I don't know why he's so angry, he clearly wants to be there. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses irony by claiming the firefighter 'clearly wants to be there' when the entire thread context shows he told the Prime Minister to 'go and get f*ed,' indicating the opposite. This feigned agreement mocks the dismissive tone of previous comments that minimized the firefighter's legitimate anger."
35,"Colorized by me: Albert Einstein teaching at Lincoln, the United States first Historical Black University, 1946 ||| I've never seen this picture of Einstein. Great colorization and post OP! ||| I haven’t either I wish there were more photos of him ||| There are a lot of pictures of Einstein.",There were more pictures that were not taken,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,78,"The response uses absurdist logic (stating an obvious tautology about photos not taken) to mock Comment 3's wish for more Einstein photos. It's a sarcastic way of pointing out that wishing for more photos is illogical—of course there are photos that weren't taken, but that doesn't help the person's desire."
36,"A $100 Joke ||| Real talk though why do so many furries play this game? I've never noticed so many furry avatars in any other game ||| Wouldn't call myself a furry, but putting furry porn sprays up in trade servers to make mods mad is 10/10. ||| Porn sprays in general are 10/10",Tf2 fanbase has gotten better  but I guess that's the cost of ftp.,SARCASM,SARCASM,82,"The response sarcastically claims the TF2 fanbase has 'gotten better' while the thread shows crude behavior (porn sprays, provocative avatars), implying the opposite—that the fanbase has actually gotten worse. The statement that this degradation is 'the cost of f2p' uses false equivalence to mock the situation."
37,"Disaster is unfolding in Syria as videos emerge of US allies being slaughtered and hundreds of ISIS prisoners escape during airstrikes ||| Have fun spinning this, Mitch McConnell... ||| No spin needed. What will happen is in 2-4 years, there will be an attack, Democrats will now be in power, and they will be blamed. It’s a long game... Edit: lets see how well this post ages. I seem to have nailed a pretty large consensus... ||| ""Why do the Kurds hate us??? They hate us for our freedom!"" No you fucktards, they hate you because you betrayed them and they actually had to gather the body parts of their children!","No worries for you, the attacks will happen in Europe. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,82,"The response uses sarcasm by feigning reassurance ('No worries') while actually making a dark, cynical point that attacks will occur in Europe instead, implying indifference to non-American casualties. The tone of false comfort contrasts with the grim reality being stated, mocking the political blame-game discussed in the thread."
38,"Insane angle of Mahomes no look pass ||| It looks even more insane from this angle. Not only is he throwing it accurately and hitting the receiver in stride without looking, but he gets a good amount of zip on the ball with literally just his arm. The rest of his body is just doing something else. ||| The rest of his body is at the bar celebrating the OT win.","Barkeep, I'll take one ketchup, straight up, please.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response is a humorous jab at Patrick Mahomes' well-known habit of putting ketchup on food. By ordering 'ketchup straight up,' the commenter is sarcastically mocking Mahomes' quirky eating preference in a playful way, using exaggeration and absurdist humor to make fun of him."
39,"Black security guard who stops shooter is then shot and killed by police ||| Oh, please no. ||| 'Upon arrival Officers learned there were several gunshot victims inside the bar.' Why wasn't this reported as a mass shooting on the news?",Mass shootings in bars are old news. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically dismisses mass shootings as 'old news' in a context discussing why a tragic incident wasn't reported, implying criticism of media coverage rather than genuinely accepting such violence as commonplace and unworthy of attention."
40,Sexist comedienne gets owned over recent London terror attacks. ||| I'm sorry but...who is this Sofia Hagen? You say she's a comedienne but I've never heard of her nor seen her work. Is she another one of those performers whom makes it their life mission to elicit reactions from people? I've got a feeling she might be. ||| Danish comedienne. Not famous at all. Just does small gigs on tv or standup. Think her 15 min of fame went to her head,Or she believes shocking people will keep her relevant.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response presents a genuine alternative explanation for Sofia Hagen's behavior that aligns with the thread's discussion about her seeking attention. It's a straightforward, non-ironic statement that directly supports the conversational theme without contradicting its literal meaning."
41,"Senator Sanders to ask why drug, once free, now costs $375k ||| The US health ""care"" system is nothing but an extortion racket. ||| Some would argue that the same is true of our housing and education markets. ||| If one small company could supply this drug free then manufacturing costs must be almost nothing. This company has no excuse and cannot justify the price they have put on this drug. They should be sued and the company seized and all right to manufacture any medication given freely to other manufacturers that have a record of reasonable price increases over the years.",But that is socialism or communism & those aren’t Murican! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggeration and feigned agreement to mock the argument that price controls or government intervention would be 'un-American.' The casual misspelling 'Murican' and dismissive tone suggest the speaker is sarcastically echoing a common objection rather than genuinely endorsing it, implying criticism of those who use this argument to defend the status quo."
42,"Five years ago, the city of Windsor, ON caved to fears and removed fluoride from their drinking water. After a 51% spike in cases of tooth decay in children, theyve now voted to spend $850,000 to re-add fluoride to their water. ||| I live in Prince George, BC. They took the fluoride out 3 years ago. To save money. I wonder what it's gonna cost when they go to reinstall the system? ||| Wait really? I didn't know that 😐 I'll need to get some fluoride rinse i guess ||| I dont know for sure but I think if you brush and floss regularly the fluoride is mostly redundant. It's for people (children) who neglect to brush their teeth.",Aren't their teeth just going to fall out anyway? ,SARCASM,SARCASM,82,"The response uses exaggeration and rhetorical irony to mock Comment 4's dismissive stance toward fluoride. By sarcastically suggesting teeth will 'just fall out anyway,' the speaker is implying that Comment 4's argument about fluoride being redundant is absurdly oversimplified, especially given the context of the 51% spike in tooth decay mentioned at the start of the thread."
43,"Insane Ripper Spree ||| Sigh, if I tried that, the first guy facing me would have a Locus and perfect aim ||| [Yup, happened to my friend earlier](<URL>",thats bullshit lol. the gun wasnt even in line with his body.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response appears to be a genuine criticism of a gameplay clip, pointing out a technical flaw (gun positioning) rather than using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant. The 'lol' suggests casual tone but not sarcastic intent."
44,"Angel gang rise up ||| Being able to reroll the half key as Isaac with d6 is great. I always prefer angel rooms over devil if I'm playing Isaac. ||| Or finding filigree feather also. Just have to remember to actually have a bomb going in, and to actually bomb the stupid statue","You can bomb the statue?? Man, I feel like a dummy for not trying that",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response appears to be a genuine expression of surprise and realization about a game mechanic the commenter was unaware of. The self-deprecating comment 'I feel like a dummy' is sincere frustration rather than ironic mockery, and there's no indication of feigned agreement or opposite meaning."
45,"for 40 years they have tried and it has never been passed. ||| Until oil is over $80/bbl it won't be profitable to drill in the Arctic, so we got that going for us, which is nice. ||| Time to take to the streets and fill them with protests again","That’s worked so much! It prevented Trump from being elected, Betsy Devos from being appointed, Scott Pruit from being appointed, Net Neutrality from being destroyed, And so many other things. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses feigned agreement to mock the suggestion of protesting. By listing major political outcomes that protests allegedly 'prevented' but actually occurred (Trump was elected, DeVos was appointed, Pruitt was appointed, Net Neutrality was destroyed), the speaker is sarcastically suggesting that protests have been ineffective, directly contradicting the literal meaning of praise."
46,"EA removed the refund button on their webpage, and now you have to call them and wait to get a refund. ||| Is that legal? ||| I'm guessing EA just has to offer refunds in one way or another for it to be legal, regardless of how difficult it is to get one. ||| In EU you have to allow access to get a refund in the same medium I bought the item, If I bought it via web I must have a way get a refund via web","you do, you access the phone number you use to call them via the web. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses ironic pedantry to mock the absurdity of EA's practice. By technically arguing that accessing a phone number on the web satisfies the legal requirement for web-based refunds, it sarcastically highlights how EA is exploiting a loophole while violating the spirit of consumer protection law."
47,"What will be the ""turns out cigarettes are bad for us"" of our generation? ||| It's already happening, but Low-Fat products. They are jacked up with sugar and not at all healthy for you. Also I'm so happy that this war on Fat is coming to an end. I literally eat ghee and avocados all day and lose weight. Edit: I didn't expect my comment to blow up. To clarify: yes I know about caloric intake and it's role in weight loss. I also know that fat loss doesn't equate to weight loss and lastly, my comment pertains to the food and pharma industry's attack on healthy fats by claiming that eggs and fish are unhealthy, suggesting that people should consume low fat items which were instead loaded with sugars and not healthy. ||| > avocados all day You fool! You'll never be able to afford a house!",lol has nothing to do with eating avocados. He's just a lazy millennial ,SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response appears to be a genuine, dismissive counter-argument to Comment 3's joke about avocado affordability, suggesting the real reason for housing unaffordability is millennial laziness rather than avocado consumption. While it could be read as mocking millennials, it's a straightforward statement rather than ironic or saying the opposite of what is meant."
48,Trump publicly admits he fired White House official as retaliation for impeachment testimony: He was very insubordinate ||| I guess he's talking about both Alexander and Yevgeny? I'm real interested to hear his reasoning behind canning Yevgeny.,Probably couldn't tell which one was which so he fired them both to be safe.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggeration and irony to mock Trump's decision-making, suggesting he fired officials out of confusion rather than legitimate reasons. The absurdist logic ('couldn't tell which one was which so he fired them both to be safe') is clearly not meant literally but rather sarcastically critiques the firing as arbitrary and poorly reasoned."

50,"Boy who suffered up to 100 seizures a day has none in 300 days after being prescribed cannabis oil ||| Sure, no seizures is great, but now hes morally devoid. ","It's ok, all he has to do is ask Jesus for forgiveness after every hit. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses irony and feigned agreement to mock Comment 2's moralistic stance about cannabis use. By suggesting a religious workaround ('ask Jesus for forgiveness after every hit'), it ridicules the notion that cannabis causes moral deviance, implying the concern is unreasonable."
51,"Vettel taking off a Mercedes cap on a kid, replaces it with a Ferrari cap ||| TIL how to steal a driver's cap. ||| 1) Be a kid. 2) Wear a rival driver's hat 3) ... 4) Profit",You only need to get one had and then meet every driver.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response appears to be a genuine, logical continuation of the joke about collecting driver caps. The person is suggesting a practical (though humorous) approach to the money-making scheme by reusing one hat with multiple drivers, which is a straightforward extension of the comedic premise rather than an ironic or sarcastic statement."
52,Blizzard pulls Blitzchung from Hearthstone tournament over support for Hong Kong protests ||| Tried to delete my account. Blizzard sends a code. I enter it. Once. TOO MANY ATTEMPTS!

I hate what China is doi,"Oh God, Chinese snipers in the thread, get dow",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggeration and dark humor to mock the thread's paranoia about Chinese censorship/surveillance. The phrase 'Chinese snipers in the thread, get down' is an absurdist, ironic overstatement that ridicules the escalating concern about Blizzard's relationship with China discussed above it."
53,"EA: They’re not loot boxes, they’re “surprise mechanics,” and they’re “quite ethical” ||| This should give their PR guys a great opportunity for a sense of pride and accomplishment. ||| This was what I was looking for. Up you go! ||| Did you give that man silver?","He's getting a sense of pride and accomplishment, he doesn't need silver.

54,"What screams ""Im not a good person"" ? ||| Queue jumping.

The exaggerated outrage at sirens contradicts the rational context of emergency vehicles needing priority access."

",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggerated feigned criticism ('how dare you', 'shameful') to actually defend the behavior of thinking critically before judgment, which is the opposite of what the literal words suggest. The tone is clearly mocking the idea that critical thinking is wrong."
56,"To everyone spending money to get Black Ops 3 supply drops... ||| I understand the lure of buying supply drops (I want the MX Garand so bad!), but I really hate having to spend just to have a CHANCE at getting what I want.

As far as I know, this is the most successful COD yet.",MW3 still holds the record for best selling CoD game.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response is a factual statement about MW3 being the best-selling CoD game, presented as a counterpoint to the claim that Black Ops 3 is 'the most successful CoD yet.' While it undermines the previous commenter's argument, it does so through a factual claim rather than irony or feigned agreement."

Good job svenskjävel",> it is from swedish Which is exactly why we *don't* use that word in Finland ,SARCASM,SARCASM,75,"The response uses ironic logic to mock the linguistic connection between Scandinavian languages. By claiming Finland doesn't use the word specifically because it's Swedish (rather than admitting Finnish has its own linguistic reasons), it sarcastically highlights the playful rivalry between Nordic countries, especially given the preceding 'svenskjävel' (Swedish devil) comment."

Mod please softban ,SARCASM,SARCASM,82,"The response uses humorous exaggeration and ironic tone, jokingly 'forbidding' someone from emotional relief and asking mods to 'softban' them. The literal meaning (enforcing emotional rules) contrasts with the playful, joking intent in the context of a sports fan's anxious anticipation."
62,"Petition to implement a refresher course for drivers over the age of 70 ||| Drivers age 75-79 have a rate of 369 accidents per 100 million miles driven (2008-09). The rate does go up substantially (to 745) for drivers over the age of 85. The rate for drivers age 20-24 is 797. For 18-19 it is 1,136, and for 16-17 it is 2,152. It holds true in different years studied and in different ways of looking at the data, like rate of accidents per 10,000 drivers. [Source](URL) (table 2) Stories of that 72-year-old bad driver you encountered do not disprove this any more than your uncle telling you ""Hey it was warm in February this year"" debunks climate change. You shouldn't only care about statistics when they support what you kneejerk believe anyway. Reddit's demographics make these statistics hard to accept though, I realize.","Thank you for bringing some good data into the equation. According to this thread, everyone below age 25 should also be banned from driving. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggeration and feigned agreement to mock the original commenter's position. By taking the data to its logical extreme (banning all drivers under 25), the response sarcastically highlights that the commenter's argument about age-based refresher courses is inconsistent with the actual statistics showing younger drivers have higher accident rates."

By suggesting a future where NOT murdering someone would be noteworthy enough for satirical coverage, the speaker is sarcastically highlighting how normalized and expected such violence has become, thereby making a serious social commentary through feigned casualness."
64,"Petition to remove Parliamentary food and alcohol subsidies in response to the repeal of free school meals for the poor ||| This will get a 5 second discussion and get thrown out ||| Yep, I've signed many petitions like this and have come to learn that they're meaningless...the very people that this petition is aimed at are the same people that will ""discuss"" it in parliament...doesn't take a genius to figure out that this isn't gonna get very far ||| Better to keep trying than give up.","Yeah, that WW1 mentality... just keep running at the guns ",SARCASM,SARCASM,82,"The response uses the WWI trench warfare metaphor sarcastically to mock the 'keep trying' advice by comparing it to a futile, self-destructive strategy (running at machine guns). The speaker is feigning agreement while actually criticizing the naive optimism of continuing to submit petitions that will be ignored by the very people in power."
65,"Republicans tried to rig the vote in Michigan – but ‘political novices’ just defeated them: After a Republican bragged about cramming ‘Dem garbage’ into certain districts, a grassroots campaign has given the power to redraw political maps to the people ||| >In 2017, the group drafted the measure to give redistricting authority to 13 Michigan residents – four Democrats, four Republicans and five non-affiliated voters, instead of lawmakers. Seems reasonable. >In the recent lawsuit in Michigan, Republicans took issue with a provision prohibiting anyone with close partisan connections from serving on the panel to ensure the districts are drawn fairly. They argued that those restrictions effectively punish them for their political beliefs and asked a federal judge to stop the creation of the commission. Um, no. You have four Republicans on the panel. You just can't have party hacks on the panel. There's a difference.","To be fair, the five non-partisan probably lean towards the Dems in redistricting because they're not biased to the right ",SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response appears to be a genuine (if flawed) political argument claiming non-partisan voters would favor Democrats, rather than ironic or mocking commentary. The phrase 'to be fair' suggests the speaker is attempting a sincere counterargument, though the logic is debatable."
66,"Same-sex marriage is now legal in Australia! ||| Today is one of those days that's going to be talked about in history classes for decades to come. ||| 7 December 2017 - Australia was one of the last holdouts of Western civilization to finally bestow basic human rights to homosexual people.

67,"Reddit is finally starting to get it! ||| Except most of those people see less business in government as harsher regulations. ||| If we continue to allow business to socialize costs then we need to accept that people will want to socialize profits. It would obviously be better to go the other way but business will never stop lobbying for handouts and our representatives will never stop giving it to them. ||| The fuck? Then you strip their powers so that business can't leverage Government force to their advantage. Businesses often secure their advantages *via* regulatory bodies. More regulations means more security for the status quo of a market. In fact, markets with fewer regulations have more competition. Think about it. The power is attracting business interests, so what you want to do is put all the power over their market in one easy to access place (the regulatory body in Washington)? That doesn't make any sense.",Exactly Monopolies and price gouging are GOOD THINGS. The big government should mind it's own business by staying out of regulating business! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggeration and feigned agreement to mock the argument. By claiming monopolies and price gouging are 'GOOD THINGS,' the speaker is sarcastically restating the opponent's position in an absurdly extreme way to ridicule it, especially through the contrast between the capitalized emphasis on 'GOOD THINGS' and the obviously negative nature of monopolies and price gouging."
68,"Oh silly me. I thought she had raped him. With him being 11 and all. ||| This apparently happened in Florida. The relevant part of Florida's law on sexual battery (Florida law doesn't use the term rape) curtesy of RAINN (<URL> is: >A person 18 years of age or older who commits sexual battery upon, or in an attempt to commit sexual battery injures the sexual organs of, a person less than 12 years of age commits a capital felony, which is punishable by death or life imprisonment, with no possibility of parole.

I suspect she won't get anything near life in prison or death.",> *Sexual Battery is defined as...* Maybe the Judge will believe that this definition doesn't apply when the penetrated belongs to the indicted person.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically suggests that a judge might ignore the legal definition of sexual battery when the perpetrator is the same person as the victim, which is absurd and logically impossible. The sarcasm mocks the implicit absurdity of such a legal interpretation while commenting on the previous statement that the perpetrator 'won't get anything near life in prison.'"
69,"OC George Has Beef with the New AP Poll ||| ""PLAY SOMEBODY!"" that killed me ||| Hey, they have at least one quality loss.","Are you referring to GU, Auburn or VTech?",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,82,"The response sarcastically questions which team the previous commenter meant by listing multiple options, implying that many teams have 'quality losses' - a mocking way of suggesting the AP Poll's reasoning is flawed or overused. The feigned confusion serves as social commentary on the absurdity of the polling logic."
70,Lebron James response to Kyle Lowry and Warriors part-owner incident ||| Every sports league in the world wants their face of the league to be exactly like LeBron. the NBA and Adam silver are extremely fortunate,hol up nephew u telling me brad marchand isn't a good ambassador for the NHL? ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response sarcastically suggests Brad Marchand (known for biting incidents and dirty play) is a good ambassador for the NHL, which directly contradicts the thread's point about LeBron being an exemplary league face. The 'hol up nephew' opener and exaggerated tone mock the premise by using an obviously poor counterexample."

72,"Lamps in Videogames use real electricity. ||| Only on an OLED screen an Led screen is always lit in the background and the pixels just have a little shutter to block to the light from comin through ||| Taking the screen out of the equation, lights put additional strain on the graphic processing, which takes electricity. It can range from an absolutely trivial amount, as in putting a sprite on the screen, to a simple translucent polygon, to some more advanced methods using ambient occlusion, phong shading, etc., to cutting edge stuff I don't know the jargon for. Edit: just pointing out I have a very limited knowledge of graphics. The main point I was making is that some portion of the power draw would go into lighting if lighting is present that would not be used by lighting if lighting were not present. That said, reading responses I suddenly want to really read up on it. ||| Actually you're right, yeah ambient occlusion, maybe if the game is ray tracing then yeah lights in games would draw more power","Wouldnt even have to be just ambient occlusion, facing the light source will draw surface reflections. Honestly folks, just equip a flashlight ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response starts with legitimate technical discussion about surface reflections and lighting calculations, but then abruptly pivots to 'just equip a flashlight' as a solution to reduce GPU power consumption from in-game lighting—which is absurd and contradicts the entire discussion. This absurd non-sequitur is clearly sarcastic humor mocking the technical conversation."

Frant!  in case it's not obvious!",SARCASM,SARCASM,95,The response uses exaggeration and false claims (a fake 18th president name) to mock the counterfeit bill while pretending to validate it as legitimate. The phrase 'in case it's not obvious!' further emphasizes the sarcastic intent by highlighting how absurd the claim is.
74,"Amber Rudd shuts down my speech about arms sales to Saudi Arabia ||| Wow, the passing of the note. What was this meeting for? ||| This was a hustings for the Hastings and Rye constituency. Shocked. This just happened last night.","Hustings for Hastings. This is why it isn't on the news, it's too much of a tongue-twister. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggeration and irony to mock the idea that a tongue-twister phrase would be the reason a political event isn't in the news, when the real reason is likely the suppression of discussion about arms sales. The literal meaning (blaming a tongue-twister) contrasts sharply with the actual context."

This exaggerated understatement is meant to mock or comment on the perceived unfairness or absurdity of the trade deal."

The juxtaposition is clearly meant to ridicule the Browns' historic futility rather than state a neutral fact."
77,"Senate defies Trump, passes historic resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen war ||| Still dreaming of a day where it's just called Arabia. The house of Saud is a scourge on the world.","Yeah, it’s weird how they’re called “Saudis” after the royal family as if they're serfs or something. Totally medieval.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,72,"The response uses exaggeration and feigned agreement to mock the previous comment's criticism. The phrase 'Totally medieval' is delivered as mock agreement while the sarcastic tone criticizes the absurdity of the preceding complaint, suggesting the commenter is not genuinely outraged by the naming convention but rather sarcastically dismissing the complaint as trivial."
78,229 House Republicans just voted to keep trump’s tax returns secret ||| Great leadership. Men of the people.,It's fine. trump said he would never lie to us. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses feigned agreement and irony to mock Trump's trustworthiness, implying the opposite of what is literally stated. The sarcastic tone contrasts sharply with the critical context about hiding tax returns, suggesting Trump is actually untrustworthy."
79,"Unfortunately, the Mane to Madrid rumours were true after all... ||| Remo—ahhhh you got me you little shit. ||| Quality shitpost",He ducking made my heart beat faster and get all nervous,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,"The response expresses genuine emotional reaction to being pranked/fooled by Comment 2's fake-out about 'Remo' (likely Ronaldo).

What's your weekly workout routine like?",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,82,"The response is a genuine compliment combined with a sincere question about workout routine. While it contains hyperbole ('beat the Predator'), it's meant as flattery rather than ironic criticism, and the question seeks actual information in a respectful manner."
81,"Dont cure an infants disability without consent ||| It's pretty weird how parts of the deaf community will shun those who gain the ability to hear. ||| Why is this intense isolationism such a huge thing in the deaf community, but not among, say, blind people? Is it because deafness is a lot more common? Do blind people do this too, and I just don't know about it? ||| Because deaf people share a language completely seperate from ours. They socialize seperately from us. They get incredibly close knit, kind of out of necessity. Blind people can socialize with most people fairly normally.",You watch two deafers signing at each other and tell me they aren't planning an uprising! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggerated humor and irony by suggesting that deaf people signing together are 'planning an uprising,' which is an absurd and ridiculous claim meant to mock the conspiratorial undertone of isolationism accusations. The hyperbolic nature and joking tone contrast with the literal meaning, making it clear the speaker is not being serious but rather using sarcasm to critique unfounded fears about the deaf community."

Everyone knows cameramen are just robots and anyone could do their job. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggeration and irony to mock the dismissive attitude toward cameramen's contributions.

But then games would last longer if they were more balanced therefore more servers needed . More people buy premiums if they get destroyed in one game , etc.",If I buy the new overpowered premium I can finally win! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggeration and irony to mock the pay-to-win mechanics discussed in Comment 3, implying that buying a premium tank guarantees victory when the speaker likely knows this isn't true. The tone is satirical, critiquing the game's business model where spending money on overpowered premiums is presented as the solution to losing."
90,"If “OK Boomer” was a digital assistant like “OK Google” what sorts of answers would it give you to certain questions? ||| ""Ok Boomer, where's the nearest recycling center."" ""We have trash cans.""","""Just throw it out the car window. The chain gang'll pick it up.""",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response mockingly suggests littering and relying on convict labor as a solution to recycling, which is clearly absurd and intended to satirize outdated or irresponsible boomer attitudes rather than offer genuine advice. The exaggeration and dark humor are consistent with the sarcastic tone established in the thread's premise about what an 'OK Boomer' assistant would say."
91,Happy New year everyone 🎉 ||| imagine not being in 2019 over an hour ago this meme was made by chatham gang ||| Wait do those cunts over there have internet? Wait are you one of those cunts? Happy new year mate!,"Nah, everyone knows they use a complex network of carrier pigeons for their internet connections.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,95,The response uses absurd exaggeration (carrier pigeons for internet) to mock the previous commenter's implication that people in a certain location are technologically backward. The obviously false claim is meant ironically to deflate the stereotype.
92,"The New Zealand Parliament has, for the first time, debated what action should be taken on climate change. Quite an historic debate as every single party is in agreement that not only is climate change a fact, but that we should be doing something about it.

Thanks NZ for making us look bad.",Not as embarrassing as the wallabies last 13 years of bledisloe cup performances,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a genuine, literal comparison making a joke about Australia's rugby team's poor performance in the Bledisloe Cup over 13 years. It's a straightforward sports joke rather than sarcasm, as the speaker actually means that the rugby losses are more embarrassing than the climate policy situation."
93,"What’s a suitable punishment for people who litter in national parks? ||| Make them clean the park Edit: thanks for the silver you three. I didn’t expect that many upvotes... 😳 ||| I like this. It's level headed and not a form of medieval or psychological torture and it accomplishes 3 things: 1) Serves as a deterrent. Cleaning a park is time-consuming and exhausting and unappealing. 2) Shows the person first-hand the consequences of their actions. They now know what someone else would have to deal with as a result of their actions. 3) The person has a chance to explore and perhaps gain a new appreciation for the park they were destroying. I imagine that at least a few people would be captivated by nature and the park's beauty while cleaning it, and that would really teach the lesson well. ||| Okay... let's assume they refuse to clean the park. What then?","Either the electric chair or being hang in public, their choice. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses extreme exaggeration (electric chair or public hanging) as a form of dark humor to mock the previous commenter's reasonable suggestion. The absurdly disproportionate punishments contrast sharply with the level-headed discussion about cleaning parks, indicating the speaker is being facetious rather than serious."
94,"Im seeing more and more of this: feminists using ""mansplaining"" accusations to deal with being publicly proven wrong ||| Someone posts factually incorrect information. Man posts corrected information. That's mansplaining? I don't even think he replied to the ""what if you can't ship in a hurricane"" comment. He was still in the the process of explaining USB power banks. He wasn't patronizing, he was merely factual. ||| If a man explains anything, it's mansplaining. it's in the name. Man explaining. So it's better if you just do anything you want around a woman and don't explain anything than risk the chance to trigger her and be 100% a rapist and racist. A rapcist if you will...","If you are a man, you already are 100% rapist. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggerated feigned agreement with the previous commenter's absurd claim to mock and ridicule their argument. By taking their hyperbolic logic to an even more extreme conclusion, it's highlighting the irrationality of the original statement through irony."
95,The Winged Wheel does not stand for hate (Cross post from r/DetroitRedWings) ||| Hitler didn't keep his head on a swivel. ||| His own goal in the 1945 SCF was the nail in the coffin for his team.,"To be fair, it was the series against the Red Army that killed their Cup run.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response continues a pattern of dark humor by treating WWII/Nazi Germany as if it were a sports team with playoff series, using 'to be fair' to feign serious sports analysis while discussing historical atrocities. This maintains the sarcastic tone of previous comments that mock Hitler and WWII through hockey metaphors."
96,"Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V.

The speaker is jokingly demanding gold in exchange for making preparations, which is lighthearted banter related to the earlier discussion about gold awards, but not using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant."
97,Not again! ||| lol and then white guy knocking out black guy and proceeding to go after woman is me going into services.msc and ***permanently disabling Windows updates*** ||| That's less knocking him out and more ending his life.,You can revert it though so just putting the guy the left in an induced comma,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,78,"The response uses ironic understatement by comparing a serious action (ending someone's life) to a minor, reversible one (induced coma), mirroring the thread's pattern of treating severe outcomes as casual computer maintenance tasks. The phrase 'just putting the guy in an induced coma' trivializes harm through false equivalence with the earlier metaphor about disabling Windows updates."
98,Chuck Taylor uses a live grenade on Ciampa and feels the effect ||| I dunno how the audience didn't get the impact,The splash damage was thankfully relegated to the ring due to the number of bodies surrounding the explosion.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggerated technical language ('splash damage', 'relegated to the ring') to describe a wrestling move with a fake grenade in a humorous, tongue-in-cheek manner. The tone is mockingly analytical about a clearly fictional scenario, contrasting with the absurdity of treating pro wrestling as a real explosion event."
99,"The Chicago Blackhawks have been eliminated from playoff contention by the St. Louis Blues in 7 games ||| *Blues players elated after defeating Blackhawks, celebrate, shocked when told that more playoff rounds exist after the first.* ||| Take ur upvote dickweed.

The tone matches the literal meaning - the person is acknowledging their work was worth the effort, which aligns with the playful humor of the thread without contradicting the stated meaning."
100,"Jon Jones replies to the death of Daniel Cormiers dad ||| [Cormier did the same for Jones mother passing](<URL> ||| Because everyone understands how much a parent means to a person. ||| Both my parents abandoned me, I must be some shit.",Have you tried winning the Strikeforce Heavyweight Grand Prix to gain their approval?,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses absurdist humor and exaggeration, suggesting an unrealistic accomplishment (winning a specific MMA tournament) as a solution to parental abandonment. This is clearly meant ironically to mock the commenter's self-deprecating comment, not as genuine advice."
101,"Recent Rape case involving MLA of Unnao ||| We are busy building statues, we don't have time for these petty rape cases ",Foot massaging and showering flowers on kanwariyas ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response sarcastically lists trivial religious/cultural activities (foot massaging, showering flowers on kanwariyas) to mock the government's priorities, implying these are being focused on instead of serious issues like rape cases, thereby reinforcing the previous comment's criticism about misplaced priorities."
102,The bar has been raised/lowered. ||| Samsung’s exploding phones was a good run at the championship belt. ||| It certainly cost the company more than these 2 combined.,"Probably yes, if you remember you weren’t to board on an airplane if you had a Note7!",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,The response is a straightforward factual statement about the Samsung Note7 being banned from airplanes due to battery explosion risks. It supports the previous comment about the financial cost and severity of the issue without irony or contradiction between literal and intended meaning.
103,Avengers Infinity War Official Trailer ||| I can tell this movie is unrealistic because all the school bus windows slide down so easily. ||| And it's not rattling like it's constantly on a 3rd world road. Not that the Queensboro Bridge is much better... ||| There should be that one window that only goes halfway,Also because a bus full of New Yorkers see something crazy happening and actually pay attention to it.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response sarcastically suggests that New Yorkers paying attention to something crazy is unrealistic, when the actual common perception is that New Yorkers are famously indifferent and ignore unusual events. The speaker is feigning agreement with the 'unrealistic movie' premise to make a joke about New York culture."
104,"I CRACKED THE CODE GUYS, FOR REAL. ||| The image is 109 x 109 pixels by the way ;) ||| dammit edmund",You think Pitchfork Emporium has a branch of Tinfoil Hat Emporium? We could probably get a bulk discount.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses mock-serious language and exaggeration to ridicule the thread starter's claim of 'cracking the code,' sarcastically implying they're a conspiracy theorist who needs tinfoil hats. The reference to a 'Pitchfork Emporium' (a well-known meme) combined with 'Tinfoil Hat Emporium' mocks conspiracy thinking through feigned agreement."
105,"37 years ago today, we lost one of our best. RIP Terry Fox. ||| His influence is worldwide. I come from a small town in the west of Ireland and every year we have the Terry Fox run to raise money for Cancer Ireland. It’s one of the largest community events of the year and 1,500 people run it in a town with a population of 2,000-3,000.

Thanks for sharing!","In the essence of sharing, [this started on Wednesday](<URL>",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,45,"The response appears to be an incomplete or fragmented message with a broken link reference. It's unclear what point is being made, making it difficult to assess sarcasm definitively, but the incomplete nature suggests technical error rather than intentional sarcasm."
106,"Multilinguals, whats your ""they didnt realise I could understand their language"" story? ||| I live in England but I come from Poland and am fluent in Polish alongside English. Couple of days ago I was ordering at a Subway when two Polish employees started talking. It went something along the lines of ""this fatass wants chicken AND bacon"" and they laughed (on a side note I feel like thats not that uncommon of an order, right?). When it got to putting vegetables on the sub, I gave my order fully in Polish with a big smile on my face. The order cost me £4.80, but the looks on their faces were priceless.","Idk what's wrong with those people, chicken and bacon is an excellent combination",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a genuine agreement with the original poster's aside question about whether chicken and bacon is a common order. The commenter is validating the poster's point that the employees were wrong to mock the order, not using irony or feigned agreement."
107,"What do you mean “us” your little sister did all he work ||| >Little sister is Dora the Explorer >""Swiper no swiping!"" x3 >""Aw, man!"" ||| She's going to be disappointed when she's older.

I was just informing they were cousins.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a straightforward factual correction about character relationships from Dora the Explorer, followed by a clarification about what the original poster said. There is no irony, exaggeration, or intent to mock - it's a genuine attempt to correct misinformation in the thread."
108,Discussion Mad Respect for Luca ||| I'll donate in his name I suggest you do the same if you want to thank him. ||| Maybe he can suggest a charity close to his heart ? We can all get together and contribute.,"Donate for Aleppo, they need it the most right now.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response appears to be a genuine suggestion for a charitable cause (Aleppo) in response to the discussion about where to donate in someone's name. While the suggestion may be controversial or debatable, the tone is straightforward and sincere rather than ironic or mocking."
109,"TIL Michael Jordan once tipped a waitress a $5 chip for bringing him a drink. Wayne Gretzky stopped the waitress, removed the $5 chip, grabbed one of the many $100 chips on Jordan’s side of the table, and gave it to her. Then he said, Thats how we tip in Las Vegas, Michael. ||| My uncle is good friends with Wayne and he came to my birthday party when I was a kid. He gave me a signed picture in a little frame and I remember thinking gee what a lame gift. ||| I was probably 7 or 8 years old, so any gift that wasn't toys was automatically pretty lame to me. ||| Yeah, but that gift is probably worth more tha any toy you had","I dunno, buzzfeed likes to publish those lists that says my cousin is sitting on a goldmine. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,78,"The response uses a cynical, dismissive tone toward BuzzFeed's common clickbait articles about hidden valuables ('goldmine'), implicitly mocking the idea that old signed memorabilia is actually worth significant money as suggested in the previous comment. The phrase 'I dunno' combined with the jaded reference undermines the serious claim that the gift has substantial monetary value."

It's joking and absurdist in tone, but not sarcastic—the speaker isn't saying the opposite of what they mean or using irony; they're simply being playfully ridiculous."

Marijuana? ,SARCASM,SARCASM,75,"The responder is sarcastically attacking Comment 2 for mentioning marijuana by feigning offense, when Comment 2 merely made a casual observation about timing. The exaggerated accusation ('Is that all you think about?') is a mocking rhetorical device used to ridicule the previous commenter for bringing up the topic at all."
112,"One Million People Demand Trump’s Tax Return, Smashing Petition Record ||| Let guess Trump's response: 1) Fake poll; can't be verified. 2) full of names of unregistered/illegal voters, dead people, illegal immigrants. 3) Bannon said he doesn't have to. ||| > he doesn't have to. This is not wrong.","He doesn't have to, sure. However, it definitely gets to fall under wrong at the same time.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response uses straightforward language to express disagreement with Comment 3's legal claim. The phrase 'sure' acknowledges the legal point while 'However, it definitely gets to fall under wrong at the same time' directly states an opposing moral/ethical position without irony or feigned agreement."
113,"Avengers Infinity War Official Trailer ||| He has the power gem already. Rip Xandar? ||| Probably.

Then they get there and shits all gone to hell and he's like, ""I just wanted a walkman!"" and he's on his way into a Radio Shack and it gets stepped on by an alien and he's like, ""Now it's personal."" EDIT: Yes, Radio Shack is still a thing. There aren't that many stores left, but it's not totally out of business. I pass by one every day.",That's not believable at all! There's maybe like 3 radio shacks left in the whole world. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response is sarcastic because it feigns disbelief about Radio Shack's existence immediately after the previous commenter explicitly clarified in their edit that Radio Shack still operates, even if there are few locations. The response mockingly exaggerates ('maybe like 3') to contradict information just provided, making it clear the speaker is being ironic."

They are going to need way, way more.",Not if they burn them at a rate so theres slways enough beds! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses dark humor and irony by suggesting that burning bodies at a high rate would solve the hospital bed shortage, which is obviously a horrific and absurd 'solution.' This mocks the serious situation discussed in the thread by feigning agreement with an outrageous premise."

The question marks and phrasing suggest authentic confusion rather than ironic intent."
118,"Justin Trudeau closes his umbrella even though its raining to pay respects for the fallen of WW1 ||| I wish my president knew how to close an umbrella. God, that is a low bar.","Well, Smart People are saying the umbrella is black, so I guess trump didn't want to take it inside Air Force One. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggerated, absurd reasoning (claiming Trump wouldn't take a black umbrella inside Air Force One) and invokes the phrase 'Smart People are saying' as a mocking reference to Trump's characteristic speech patterns. The ridiculous logic and mimicry of Trump's rhetoric indicate satirical mockery rather than literal commentary."

Women *totally* don't care about muscular or physically attractive men. ,"And women *certainly* don't fantasize about being physically fit, attractive and sexy! ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses exaggerated agreement ('certainly') and feigned innocence to mock the previous commenter's argument by pointing out the hypocrisy in their logic. The speaker is sarcastically suggesting the opposite of what they literally state - that women DO fantasize about being physically fit and attractive, which contradicts the previous commenter's claim that women don't care about physical attractiveness."

Once you go shorts, you never go back! ||| Goddamn it nutsford this isn’t about you",But I need to spread the gospel of shorts!,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggerated, over-the-top language ('spread the gospel of shorts') to mock Comment 3's enthusiastic promotion of shorts despite being told by Comment 4 that the conversation isn't about them. The theatrical tone and hyperbolic phrasing contrast with the literal meaning, suggesting the speaker is making fun of the previous commenters' obsession with shorts."

That was the ugliest thing I've ever seen,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a genuine recollection of a specific basketball game where KU had an unusually poor first-half performance. The speaker is expressing authentic criticism about the game's quality, not using irony or mocking to convey the opposite meaning."
136,"Apple, the worlds most profitable firm, has a secretive new structure allowing it to continue avoiding billions in taxes, Paradise Papers show. They sidestepped a 2013 crackdown by actively shopping around for a tax haven, landing $252bn on the Channel Island of Jersey. ||| While poverty reaches a new height. Thanks apple. I will never buy any of your products. Come on down votes!","Yeah, you're gonna get downvoted so hard dissing Apple on reddit ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses ironic exaggeration by predicting harsh downvotes when the comment is actually expressing a common, socially-conscious criticism that typically receives upvotes on Reddit. The speaker is sarcastically inverting the actual likely outcome."
137,"Two years ago Riot promised to deliver missions for specific champions, so players can be rewarded for playing their mains. It took them 2 years to introduce it and you need to pay for it ||| ""missions are about skill, not patience"" Then a wild ""kill 12k minions as a team"" appears","Or, as a support main, my personal favourite: ""Earn 1,000,000 gold"".",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response is sarcastically highlighting an unrealistic mission requirement for support players, who typically earn less gold than other roles. The phrase 'personal favourite' is sarcastic since this would be an extremely difficult and unfavorable mission for a support main to complete."
138,"Update on the VR situation. ||| ""You should see Springtrap walk"" nah nothing beats [this] (<URL>) ||| IDK why, but when I saw that Gif my Mind was immediately like- *""On my Way to steal ~~Yo Girl~~ The Souls of Children.""*","what if my girl is the souls of children? as in, baby ",SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,75,The response is a playful wordplay joke interpreting 'girl' as 'souls of children' by using the term 'baby' as an endearment. It's a genuine attempt at humor through reinterpretation rather than saying the opposite of what is meant.
139,An old Reddit admin speaks his mind. ||| Sounds believable. Definitely the bit about Pao not knowing how to use the site. Remember when she posted a link to a PM as a story submission? ||| And now we know Pao should have never been made CEO. She can't even use Reddit properly.,Why not? The CEO of Harley Davidson doesn't even know how to ride a motorcycle! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses absurdist exaggeration to mock the logic that a CEO must personally know how to use their company's core product. The Harley Davidson comparison is deliberately ridiculous, implying the previous commenters' criticism is equally unreasonable."
140,So I drew the Ts as kids ||| I bet that kid used his parents' credit card to get the Karambit smh E: My first gold. Thank you kind stranger,Or it's just a cardboard cutout of one.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response sarcastically suggests an absurd alternative explanation (a cardboard cutout) to the previous commenter's serious accusation about credit card misuse. The absurdity of the suggestion indicates satirical intent rather than a literal alternative theory.
141,"Postgame Thread LSU Defeats Alabama 46-41 ||| Hello r/all! 2nd time today we've been here. Please make sure to read our [rules](<URL> before commenting, and enjoy!",Joe burrow earned 20 mil transferring from Ohio state to LSU as a QB,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The statement is factually incorrect - Joe Burrow transferred from Ohio State to LSU and was not paid $20 million for the transfer. This false claim appears to be sarcastic commentary, likely mocking either transfer portal practices or exaggerating Burrow's value."
142,"Facebook is thinking about removing anti-vaccination content as backlash intensifies over the spread of misinformation on the social network ||| If they cared about the spread of misinformation they would have to get rid of a lot more than just the anti-vaccination idiots. ||| Political opinions are a lot more subjective than medical science. ||| Yeah, what could go wrong with widespread political propaganda supporting authoritarianism?",The government needs to be given the authority to prevent speech in favour of authoritarianism. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses ironic contradiction: it proposes giving government authority to censor speech opposing authoritarianism, which is itself an authoritarian act. This directly contradicts the concern raised in Comment 4 about authoritarianism, making the statement sarcastic."
143,"Teachers of reddit, what is the smartest/most creative way of cheating that youve seen? ||| I was supervising a final chemistry exam along with another coworker. Not 15 minutes in, a hand slams down on a desk and I turn around expecting the worst, only to see my coworker angrily shouting at a pair of really frightened 10th graders whose desk he smashed. Amidst the shouting I caught the words, “Morse code”. The guy proceeded to take them to the office. I called a hallway supervisor to take over and ran after the group. Apparently, the kids were silently tapping the answers amongst themselves in Morse code. Not even with their fingernails, just their fingertips. I never heard a thing, my coworker happened to catch “B” in Morse code or something. I honestly thought he finally went crazy solely because of his appearance, picture Robin Williams in Jumanji going WHAT YEAR IS IT. I’m 100% sure that if this coworker weren’t in the room, they’d have gotten away with it for sure. ||| So they learned morse code but couldn’t study for a test, amazing",Learn to cheat once and you never have to study for other tests ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response ironically suggests that learning to cheat is a substitute for studying, when the context demonstrates the opposite - the students invested significant effort learning Morse code (a complex skill) only to cheat on one test. The statement is clearly meant to mock the inefficiency and flawed logic of their approach."
144,"trump sells Qatar $12 Billion of U.S. Weapons days after accusing it of funding Terrorism ||| Well, they're going to need those weapons if they're going to stand a chance of fighting Saudi Arabia, whom trump also recently signed a huge arms deal with. trump's only being fair here, guys. ||| Gotta supply the proxy wars to keep the cash rolling","No no, we're fighting the war to defeat terrorism, promise! ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses quotation marks and 'promise!' with exaggerated reassurance to mock the stated justification for arms sales, implying the actual motivation is profit rather than counterterrorism. The tone is clearly ironic given the preceding comments about hypocrisy and financial incentives."
145,We at MensRights would like to celebrate international womens day because in contrary to popular belief were not anti women! ||| Your top post of all time is a triple guided post bragging about getting banned from r/feminism. Most of your daily top posts are nothing pro men they’re just screen grabs of women saying things you disagree with. But hey yeah an annual text post to the contrary ought to do the trick anyway back to your regularly scheduled posts obsessing over female rapists and complaining about your divorces.,How dare people say positive things about men! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response misrepresents Comment 2's actual criticism (that the subreddit's actions contradict its stated values) as simply 'saying positive things about men,' which is a strawman that inverts the genuine concern raised. This exaggeration is used sarcastically to mock and delegitimize the criticism."
146,"Say what you want about Kevin Nash, but you cant deny he is a good brother! ||| Oh sure Nash can do it but when Elsworth gets on the phone with a kid it’s a witchhunt ",HAHAHA. Thank you for the christmas giggle. The  detracted a little from the joke imo.,SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a genuine compliment thanking the commenter for making them laugh. The phrase 'thank you for the christmas giggle' and constructive feedback about the joke are sincere expressions of appreciation, not sarcastic statements."
147,"Highlight Ben Simmons with the corner 3 ||| **Replays/alternate angles** *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/nba) if you have any questions or concerns.*",Arena just went from boring game to Game 7 atmosphere,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically suggests that Ben Simmons hitting a corner 3 (which is notoriously unlikely given his playing style) would dramatically transform the arena atmosphere, implying this is absurd and would never actually happen."
148,"Congress confirms Reddit admins were trying to hide evidence of email tampering during Clinton trial. ||| reddit, pepe, gamergate, the alt-right, chans, twitter trolls... How the fuck did all of this become part of mainstream American politics? It blows my mind. XD ||| We grew up and got old enough to vote and took all our shitty internet inside jokes with us.",Don't say that they are shitty. They are funny! They ARE funny!,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses emphatic repetition ('they ARE funny!') to defensively contradict the previous commenter's characterization of internet jokes as 'shitty,' which appears to be sarcastic agreement that masks disagreement or ironic commentary on the defensiveness around internet culture."
149,"Dead Kennedys - Nazi Punks Fuck Off Punk ||| <URL> If you haven't seen the movie Green Room, check it out.","So good, that scene where he sticks his hand out. Christ",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response appears to be a genuine expression of appreciation for a memorable scene from Green Room, using 'Christ' as an exclamation to emphasize the impact. The tone matches the conversational context of recommending the film."
150,"Rapoport #Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is the MVP for the 2019 season. For the second time ever, there was a unanimous MVP. Unreal. ||| Not bad for a- oh you get the point ||| For those that don’t... what were you gonna say",Think he was about to drop some racial slurs ,SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a literal interpretation of Comment 2's incomplete sentence, suggesting the commenter was about to make a racist statement. There is no irony or reversal of meaning; it's a direct, serious accusation."
151,Congratulations to UCF on winning the World Cup! ||| I can’t believe UCF has won every single championship this year. That takes some grit,I'll never forget Alex Ovechkin lifting the Stanley Cup for the first time in UCF program history.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response combines multiple false claims (Alex Ovechkin is an ice hockey player, not affiliated with UCF; the Stanley Cup is for ice hockey, not soccer/football) to mock the previous comments' exaggerations about UCF winning championships. This absurdist combination is clearly sarcastic."
152,A mother wrote to Hindustan pencils about her left-handed daughters needs and they responded ||| Apsara and Nataraj..?? By the same company..?? I've been living a lie.,That's how you create brands. Most of what you use and think are completely different could be from the same parent company.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a straightforward, informative statement explaining that different brands can be owned by the same parent company. It's educational in tone and not mocking or ironic about the commenter's surprise."
153,"Gift art to Dawko for beating 50/20! ||| This is my art btw, my twitter is @Hiroshark :)",[@Hiroshark's latest tweet](<URL> [@Hiroshark on Twitter](<URL> - ^I ^am ^a ^bot ^| ^[feedback](<URL>,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,95,"This response appears to be an automated bot sharing the artist's Twitter profile link, which is a straightforward, literal action with no ironic or mocking intent."
154,"SPECIALIST IN FAILURE Upvote so this is the first thing that comes up when you search specialist in failure. ||| Frankly I hope this idiot stays in the Man U job for as long as possible, he's doing the great job there I want him to do. I respect the fact that the man (used) to be a great manager and the many trophies he's won, But this is a guy who has never had any class whatsoever. He also had plenty of funds at his disposal after his good work with Porto and in pretty much every job since. This man has no real values unlike Wenger and even Ferguson, if he gave a toss about Chelsea (sorry Chelsea fans, he simply doesn't) he would have not taken the United job. Prestige and money is all Jose cares about and ultimately, Jose is all Jose cares about. ||| Even at Real Madrid he was kicking ass. Not sure how he goes from winning at Chelsea to just screwing everything up around him?","But,he screwed the locker room in Madrid in his later years as well",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,95,"The response is a straightforward factual counter-argument stating that the manager had locker room problems at Real Madrid, which contradicts Comment 3's claim that he was 'winning' there. There is no ironic reversal, exaggeration, or hidden meaning intended."
155,"One of these three is not like the others ||| To win a Republican primary you have to sound tough. So far, trump has sounded tough while saying the US shouldn't police the world and should withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan. He's been great on foreign policy IMO.",Especially withdrawing from the nuclear weapons treaties with Russia! Good job on keeping tensions down! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses ironic praise ('Good job on keeping tensions down!') to criticize Trump's withdrawal from nuclear treaties with Russia, which would logically increase tensions rather than decrease them. The exclamation marks and positive framing directly contradict the negative consequences being referenced."
156,Chocolate is now illegal. What’s its street name? ||| Yo you got any of that Kinder ||| Might become an issue in Germany ||| Maybe they shouldn’t have been weird and named a major chocolate brand “children”,"Yes ""Kinder Surprise"" is a horrible name for a candy treat with a toy inside. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response sarcastically agrees that 'Kinder Surprise' is a 'horrible name' when the actual issue is that 'Kinder' means 'children' in German, not that the name itself is inherently bad. The sarcasm deflects from the real point being made in Comment 4."
157,"TIL that a Polish environmental charity put a SIM card in a GPS tracker to follow the migratory pattern of a white stork. They lost track of the stork and later received a phone bill for $2,700; someone in Sudan had taken the SIM from the tracker and made over 20 hours of calls. ||| I feel like having the option of not letting people make $2700 worth of phone calls for a sim card assigned to an IOT device would have been a worthy use of time. ||| If only the world had a blockchain for these environmental issues",We should definitely use the annual national electrical usage of Ireland to track and manage these issues using a blockchain. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response sarcastically suggests using an absurdly excessive resource (Ireland's annual electricity usage) to solve a minor tracking issue, mocking Comment 3's impractical blockchain suggestion. The hyperbolic pairing of massive energy consumption with a trivial problem is clearly ironic."
158,"It would be cool if after you died you could see the top 5 times you almost died. ||| 1. Anaphylactic reaction 2. Anaphylactic reaction 3. Anaphylactic reaction 4. That girl you dated in high school, yeah I didn’t see it coming either 5. Eating a hasbrown from Maccas while hammered (had an anaphylactic reaction) Edit: cheers for the gold, wasn’t expecting that! ||| Are you from Australia?","The ""maccas"" reference didn't answer that for you? ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses sarcasm to imply that 'maccas' (Australian slang for McDonald's) was an obvious enough indicator of Australian origin that Comment 3's question was unnecessary or silly. The rhetorical question format highlights this sarcastic tone.
159,This lad went under the tarp and army crawled for 50 feet to recover the first home run ever hit by the Red Sox outside of North America ||| First home run ever hit by the Red Sox in Europe. Brandon Moss homered in Japan in 2008. ||| Damn. Now it's useless and he has to throw it back. ||| It's not nice to throw Brandon moss around like that,Moss always lands on the north side of the rock. He’ll be fine.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response plays on Comment 4's joke about 'Brandon Moss' (the player) being thrown around, treating it literally as if Moss is an object that can be thrown and will land safely. The absurdist humor of confidently stating where a person will land after being thrown is clearly sarcastic."
160,"Anybody that questions why you are shoveling six inches of snow in the *middle* of a snowstorm hasnt shoveled twelve inches of snow at the end of a snowstorm. ||| How bad is the snow right now, OP? ||| Well there was 3""-5"" (8cm - 13cm) on the ground from previous snowfall. We had approximately 6"" (15cm) on Friday night and another 6"" (15cm) on Saturday evening.

This is America we don't need those commie measurements ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response mockingly dismisses metric measurements as 'commie' while sarcastically claiming 'we don't need those people,' which is a hyperbolic and ironic critique of American resistance to the metric system. The over-the-top nature of equating helpful unit conversions with communism signals sarcastic intent."
161,PC H Full Set of Every Single Item in Rocket League W Offers (Details Inside) ||| Casually collects every item in the game because he thinks the future is bright. I support.,Sounds funny when you put it like this but yeah this is what happened :),NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,The response acknowledges that Comment 2's characterization sounds amusing but confirms it's actually accurate. The smiley face indicates genuine agreement rather than mockery or ironic intent.
162,"Mesut Özil and his fiancé will celebrate their upcoming marriage by covering the expenses for the surgeries of over 1000 kids in need ||| Please note: He said ""all over the world"". Almost everyone's insured in Germany. I have know people who tried to get out of this system, but it's really hard not to be insured here in German and most people are very glad about this.","Health insurance for everyone, sounds like communism to me ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses hyperbolic language equating universal health insurance with communism, a common sarcastic critique often used to mock right-wing political rhetoric. The speaker is likely satirizing the tendency to label social welfare systems as communist rather than expressing a genuine political stance."
163,"Kim Jong-un crosses into South Korea ||| ""A new history begins now - at the starting point of history and the era of peace."" Wow Kim Jong Un ||| I sincerely hope this is legitimately the start of an era of peace. But may I just add that Kim Jong Un is actually very eloquent. ||| Its amazing how fast people’s opinion has changed of him on here. This guys the leader of a country that murders and imprisons thousands of their own people every year.",Hitler was beautiful orator and very kind to dogs. A kindred spirits ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses Hitler as a comparison to mock the idea of praising Kim Jong Un's eloquence while ignoring his atrocities. The exaggerated praise ('beautiful orator,' 'kind to dogs,' 'kindred spirits') is clearly ironic, contrasting positive traits with historical knowledge of Hitler's evil regime to satirize Comment 3's focus on Kim's eloquence."
164,"trump shoves another NATO leader to be in the front of the group ||| This is hilarious. His face and the way he adjusts his jacket all proud of himself. ||| As an American this is so damn humiliating, he just reinforces all the worst stereotypes the world has about Americans. ||| [Humiliating? Some ""Americans"" think this guy is a cool Alpha dog for doing it","Man, that Manchester bomber - what an alpha male! He just oozes cool! ",SARCASM,SARCASM,95,The response uses extreme sarcasm by praising a terrorist bomber as an 'alpha male' to mock Comment 4's assertion that some Americans view aggressive behavior as cool. The absurdity of praising violence is clearly meant to ridicule the logic of the previous comment.
165,My room is ready to play FNAFAR!FNAF Room ||| Good luck spotting the actual animatronics in there!,I got the eye and tooth animatronics parts !(Chuck E cheese),NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response appears to be a genuine statement about having animatronic parts from Chuck E Cheese, likely joking that those parts could work as substitutes for FNAF AR animatronics. There's no clear sarcastic intent—just a humorous observation about using spare animatronic parts."
166,"Treyarch makes the most unbalanced game ever. ||| You think that's bad? I was playing domination, and I only realised after that my team was playing against 54 enemies, and they were bloody immortal.",And then my controller ran out of battery.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses escalation and absurdity to mock the increasingly exaggerated complaints in the thread. The addition of a trivial, unrelated excuse (controller battery) in response to claims of impossible game scenarios (54 enemies, immortal players) is clearly meant as humorous sarcasm highlighting how ridiculous the previous complaints are."
167,"Please, dont ask... ||| Its like looking in a mirror... ||| ... and -25 MMR staring back at you.",Jokes on you i only have 18 left,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response appears to be a self-deprecating joke rather than sarcasm. The speaker is genuinely admitting to having only 18 MMR (a low ranking in gaming), which is even worse than the -25 MMR mentioned, making it a straightforward humorous admission rather than saying the opposite of what they mean."
168,"Ohio city to stop observing Columbus Day, make Election Day holiday instead ||| What an anti-democratic power grab, making it easier for people to vote. Blatant handout to people without a lot of free time. ||| Damned citizens thinking they have the *right* to vote.",They already have guns. They don't need to vote. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,The response uses absurd logic (guns instead of voting rights) to mock the implied argument that voting accessibility doesn't matter. It's a reductio ad absurdum attacking the dismissive stance toward voting rights.
169,What’s an invention that’s still around today but has lost sight of its original purpose? ||| There are several drugs that would make the list. Cocaine and Viagra for sure though. ||| Heroin was originally advertised as an addiction free alternative to opium! ||| Exactly like how oxycontin was advertised as non-addicting just 2 decades ago!! They knew.,"It's not addictive. I should know, I take it all the time. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The statement ironically uses the claim 'it's not addictive' while simultaneously admitting to taking it 'all the time,' which is a direct contradiction that highlights the absurdity of such marketing claims discussed in the thread."
170,"73% of Canadians don’t want to cover costs for Prince Harry, Meghan Markle: poll ||| I dont mind them coming, but are they not self sufficient?",They have a combined net worth of about $30 million. Hardly enough to live on... ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses ironic understatement by suggesting that $30 million net worth is 'hardly enough to live on,' when it is objectively a substantial amount of money. This exaggeration is clearly meant to mock the implication that Harry and Meghan lack sufficient funds."
171,"Children agree not to get abducted after 8 PM so Amber Alert doesn’t wake anyone up ||| * Children weren’t abducted. * Went missing well before 8 PM. * Were missing for more than 12 hours before the alert was issued. * Grandpa didn’t steal them and was actually considered “a vulnerable adult” despite being labeled “suspect” in the alert. * Found by police, not the general public. But hey, the system worked! ||| Why did the York regional police tweet ""As a direct result of the Amber Alert"" ||| Yeah, we all know cops aren't allowed to lie.",I was literally asking. Im trying to find a source that says if they were alerted to the vans location by the public or not.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a genuine clarification stating the commenter was asking a factual question and seeking sources. There is no irony, mockery, or contradiction between stated intent and literal meaning."
172,"Found at the entrance to St George’s in Cape Town. I love this church. ||| Church is not a museum for ""good""people,but a hospital for the broken.","Fr Stephen Freeman likes to put it that Christ did not come to make bad men good, but to make dead men live.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,The response is a sincere theological reference that complements and elaborates on the previous comment's metaphor about church as a hospital. It directly supports the point being made without irony or mockery.
173,"Water ice on Mars, just shot by the ESA! ||| So would this be the first place humans might want to be near on arriving ? or is water so common there under the surface that it doesn't matter ? ||| I don’t know about the water content under the surface, but I do know that Mars has polar ice caps just like us. ||| The polar ice caps have a bunch of CO2 in them. Water ice is somewhat abundant if you count the poles, but this is pretty worthwhile to investigate.","Jeez, you watch Total Recall one time.....   ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically implies the commenter is basing their Mars knowledge on the movie Total Recall rather than actual scientific understanding, mocking the casual tone of the discussion by suggesting pop culture familiarity rather than expertise."
174,New Hero: Snapfire ||| Imagine being so insecure in your identity that you're afraid this hero makes dota like League or Hots. ||| it gets said everytime man its basically just obligatory at this point.,>Grimstroke looks like a disney princess omg dota is ded ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses exaggerated quotation marks to mock a previous complaint, mimicking an over-the-top criticism about hero design to satirize how repetitive and predictable these complaints are in the community."
175,"Having a girlfriend is cheating!  ||| Reminds me of when 2 guys at a tournament were playing and the dudes controller disconnected and the other guy paused to let him plug it back in, then the 1st guy said that he should SD because in the rules, pausing means you lost a stock. ||| Wow, that's a prime example of unsportsmanly conduct if ever I've heard one. Edit: it's 'unsportsmanlike', not 'unsportsmanly', my goof.","What's worse, is he was ignoring the fact that technically an unplug means you forfeit the round entirely, but didnt wanna hear it",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response appears to be a genuine continuation of the conversation about tournament rules and unsportsmanly conduct, providing additional rule information without ironic or contradictory intent. The tone is consistent with serious discussion about gaming rule violations."
176,"Amber Rudd shuts down my speech about arms sales to Saudi Arabia ||| I keep remembering that moment in the last debate when Caroline Lucas brought this up, and the moderator stopped it from going anywhere right when Amber Rudd was about to respond. So frustrating.",I think Rudd's response was 'it's good for business'. Disgusting person.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response expresses a genuine critical opinion about Amber Rudd's position on arms sales, calling her 'disgusting' as a sincere moral judgment rather than using irony or saying the opposite of what is meant."
177,"I just had my second son. ||| As a tax-paying New Zealander, I feel I need to tell you that I'm really happy we look after each other like this and I wish you all the best as your family grows.",Absolutely. Crushing debt should not be the environment that a person enters the world into.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,The response genuinely agrees with Comment 2's sentiment about societal support systems and expresses sincere concern about debt burden on newborns. The tone is earnest and aligns with the supportive context of the thread.
178,Synced videos of the Eagles fan running into the pillar ||| That pole should’ve lowered its shoulder 3 more inches. ||| That was a leagle hit.,"But the pole gave him the bird after the tackle, so, penalty.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses absurd logic (a pole giving someone 'the bird' as a penalty) to humorously continue the trend of treating an inanimate object (the pole) as if it were a player committing infractions, which is clearly not meant literally."
179,"Kimi Räikkönen is on pole for the 2018 Italian Grand Prix! ||| holy fucking shit he didnt bottle it finally he gets his well deserved pole ||| all the while I was expecting a sliding Kimi out of Parabolica, BUT HE HELD IT! ABSOLUTE LAD!",Everytime it cut to the camera where you couldn't see parabolica time slowed down after vettel came through until Kimi came through,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a straightforward, literal observation about camera angles and pacing during the broadcast. It contains no irony, exaggeration, or contradiction of intent typical of sarcasm."
180,SPOILER Stephen Wonderboy Thompson vs. Anthony Pettis ||| PSA: This is why you should never get in a street fight. even if you are a better fighter and winning all it takes is one punch to send you to the hospital or morgue.,Nah you don't know my mentality bro I just black out ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses hyperbolic language ('black out') and an overconfident tone ('Nah you don't know my mentality bro') to mock the serious PSA about street fight dangers, implying the speaker thinks they're immune to harm through sheer willpower or aggression."
181,“Its official! Binding of Isaac: Repentance is the FINAL (for real this time) DLC for isaac. it will include the amazing Antibirth mod + a ton more content that will make you shit your butts! im working along side @FixItVinh to tweak the mod and make it canon!“ ||| NL's life just extended 2 years!,"At this point that's just extending infinity. Kinda redundant. It prob extended hutts tho, this is gonna be a big spike for him.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,The response uses hyperbolic language ('extending infinity') but is making genuine observations about NL's (Northernlion's) documented history of playing Isaac extensively. The comment reflects actual community knowledge rather than saying something false to mock the claim.
182,"If Jeff Bezos decided to share his fortune with everyone on the planet, what would you do with your $17.50? ||| Buy a share of the now worthless amazon.",Why a share? if it’s worthless just buy amazon. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically suggests buying the entire Amazon company with $17.50, which is obviously impossible. It exaggerates the absurdity of Comment 2's suggestion that Amazon stock would be worthless by implying one could purchase the whole company with that trivial amount."
183,"Americas obsession with trucks and SUVs is helping push car loan payments to a 10-year high ||| One of my friends pays a $800 truck payment for his Ram diesel. Granted he makes $40 an hour, is single, and has a room mate. ||| I don’t see anything wrong with it. It sounds crazy to people that pay child support or have a family to support.

The rhetorical question format with obvious falsehood is a clear sarcastic device."
184,"Sacha Baron Cohen just called out the Silicon Six, a group of American billionaires that he says care more about boosting their share price than protecting democracy - our future may rests in the power of just a few who are rich ||| The six he named are: * Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook * Sundar Pichai: Alphabet/Google * Larry Page: Alphabet * Sergey Brin: Alphabet * Susan Wojcicki: Alphabet/YouTube * Jack Dorsey: Twitter PS: Edited to include companies PPS: yes, we know, Bezos should also be on the list ||| For anyone else wondering: * Mark Zuckerberg - Facebook * Sundar Pichai - Google * Larry Page - Google/Alphabet * Sergey Brin - Google/Alphabet * Susan Wojcicki - YouTube * Jack Dorsey - Twitter",So you’re saying Google is bad. But I was always told that Google is the friendliest tech company towards consumers ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,The response uses ironic understatement by claiming Google is 'the friendliest tech company towards consumers' in direct contrast to the criticism being leveled at Google executives for prioritizing profit over democracy. This is clearly said tongue-in-cheek to mock Google's public image versus its actual practices.
185,"Khabib on McGregor’s retirement: ""Conor acts like a jealous wife, who says I will leave all the time but then comes back"" ||| LMAO, that's true. Conor ain't going anywhere.

Conor has all the bargain power he wants.",Trying to build plot armor for a return title fight so that he can beat Khabib ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically suggests Conor is strategically manufacturing drama and retirement announcements as a calculated tactic to set up a comeback narrative, when in reality this would be an absurd and ineffective strategy. The deadpan delivery of an obviously counterproductive plan indicates sarcasm."
186,"President Donald trump thinks Scientology should lose its tax-exempt status in the United States ||| These people should be thrown in jail. Physical and emotional abuse, false confinement, extortion, fraud, cover-up of sexual abuse, harassment, libel, practicing medicine without a license. Revoking their tax exemption is a miniscule step in the right direction. Throw the book at them.",I'm sure Joel Osteen didn't do all of that? Seems such a standup guy. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses ironic praise ('standup guy') about Joel Osteen to sarcastically critique him, contrasting with the serious allegations mentioned in Comment 2. The quotation marks and tone suggest the opposite of what is literally stated."
187,"What common product has a feature you’re not sure everyone is aware of? ||| To totally eliminate sunburn pain, apply apple cider vinegar. I was on a family vacation and got absolutely FRIED by the 3rd day. My sister in law wanted to spray me down with it, saying it would help, but I wouldn't let her because I thought she was trying to punk me. By the evening it hurt so bad that I'd try anything. Sprayed it on with a sprayer (like a Windex bottle) and within 5 minutes the pain was gone. I was still red, of course, but the pain was 99% gone. It was absolutely miraculous! TL;DR: Apple cider vinegar magically makes sun burn pain vanish",I just got a bad sunburn yesterday. I'm totally trying this!!,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response expresses genuine enthusiasm and intent to try the remedy mentioned in the context. The double exclamation marks and 'totally' indicate authentic excitement rather than mocking tone, and there are no contradictions or ironic statements that would suggest sarcasm."
188,"One Million People Demand Trump’s Tax Return, Smashing Petition Record ||| Let guess Trump's response: 1) Fake poll; can't be verified. 2) full of names of unregistered/illegal voters, dead people, illegal immigrants. 3) Bannon said he doesn't have to.",> he doesn't have to. This is not wrong.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is making a literal legal statement that Trump has no legal obligation to release his tax returns, which is factually accurate. While the broader thread is sarcastic, this specific response appears to be a straightforward clarification of legal fact rather than sarcasm."
189,"My best friends dog was shot and killed by the police when they showed up to the wrong house. They are trying to cover it up. ||| Wake up to the American reality. This isn't the first nor last incident. Innocent people and their pets die every day. 98% of assault charges brought against cops have been dismissed within the system.

When will americans be outraged enough to demand change?",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses quotation marks around a dismissive phrase ('But its not all cops man its just a few') to mockingly represent a common defense argument, then immediately follows with rhetorical questions that express frustration with that very defense. This is sarcastic criticism of people who minimize police misconduct."
190,"Hooray to Jennifer Aniston, whos turning 50 today.

LET THIS WOMAN LIVE HER LIFE. 🤦🏻‍♀️",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is expressing genuine frustration and advocacy for Jennifer Aniston's autonomy, using emphatic language and an eye-roll emoji to convey sincere exasperation at media speculation about her personal life. The capitalization and punctuation reflect genuine emotion rather than ironic reversal of meaning."
191,"Gawker might have died, but its legacy lives on. The medias hate continues. ||| Jesus fuck, that's low even for them. ||| Remember when Brianna Wu's dog was dying and GGers searched for local vets to help her?

Remember, though, *we're* the bad guys... ||| > remember when Brianna Wu killed her own dog and blamed GG FTFY",Laci Green killed her dog after raping it.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"This appears to be a serious (though unsubstantiated) accusation made in a hostile online context, not a sarcastic comment. The statement mimics the pattern of the preceding comment which made a serious accusation against Brianna Wu, suggesting the responder is making a parallel attack rather than employing irony or sarcasm."
192,Ryan Reynolds starring in movie about a man who realizes hes a background character in a video game. Stranger Things producer Shawn Levy to direct ||| Wasn’t that kind of done in The Truman Show and Wreck-it Ralph? ||| The premise reminded me of Stranger Than Fiction.,It’s totally different. That was a book. This is a video game. Cmon. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response dismisses the comparison with exaggerated simplicity ('That was a book. This is a video game. Cmon.'), implying that changing the medium is a trivial difference when the core premise about realizing one's reality is artificial remains fundamentally similar. The tone and 'Cmon' suggest sarcastic incredulity at the obviousness of the rebuttal."
193,Graziano The Chiefs have released Kareem Hunt. ||| We'll try it out. Enjoy. ||| So he definitely lied to the chiefs right? ||| Chiefs put out a statement saying he lied to them.,but do they have a video of it,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically questions whether video evidence exists, implying that the Chiefs' statement about Hunt lying should be taken at face value without requiring video proof—a jab at how video evidence has become the standard for believing misconduct allegations."
194,"TIL the Japanese bullet train system is equipped with a network of sensitive seismometers. On March 11, 2011, one of the seismometers detected an 8.9 magnitude earthquake 12 seconds before it hit and sent a stop signal to 33 trains.

The humor relies on mocking Trump's fixation on wall-building while applying it inappropriately to a tragic situation."
195,"And after all those years, we were wondering why he didnt support his golem, with a Night witch, or anything really. ||| Link to the match he threw? ||| 3rd Match: [<URL>",I watched it and didn’t notice him throwing? He played it out it looked like to me,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a straightforward disagreement with the implied criticism that the player threw the match. The commenter is stating their genuine observation that the player played out the game normally without throwing, which is a direct factual claim rather than sarcastic commentary."
196,"#liberatehongkong ||| I just deleted Diablo from my cell phone!

The juxtaposition of platform switching for criticism is used for comedic effect."
197,"When you wake up at 7am as a European ||| Anyone have a tldr what happened? ||| TLDR of the last year: trump tears up Iran Nuclear agreement and imposed sanctions on Iran. Iran’s economy has been spiraling into chaos ever since and massive protests erupt in December with the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) violently suppressing protesters (even shutting down the internet country-wide for a week, besides killing people). IRI has provoked war a couple of times with confiscating British ships in International waters and shooting down unmanned aircraft over neutral airspace. The U.S. hasn’t retaliated militarily, but continued the sanctions. Part of Iran’s military has now entered Iraq to help stage an uprising against the U.S. presence there. They attacked the U.S. Embassy and killed a contractor working there. The U.S. has responded with a strong mobilization of troops and strikes at enemy positions, which include Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s special army (Quds) which is also a designated terrorist organization. ||| Quds is a terrorist organization according to the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel.",">according to the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel Well those are 3 countries that are obviously trustworthy without any doubt... ",SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses quotation marks and ellipsis to sarcastically suggest that the US, Saudi Arabia, and Israel are 'obviously trustworthy without any doubt,' when the speaker clearly implies the opposite—that these countries are not trustworthy sources for designating terrorist organizations."
198,Dota 2 Custom Games ||| Overthrow?

199,"Being a real grown up isn’t cooking a fancy dinner, it’s having a clean kitchen when you go to bed after cooking a fancy dinner. ||| I feel attacked right now. Who let you into my house? ||| We are all in each other’s houses :( we’ve all been there ||| ಠ_ಠ","How'd you get in here? What is this, a crossover episode?",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses exaggerated accusation ('How'd you get in here?') and an absurdist reference ('crossover episode') to humorously play along with the joke that everyone shares the experience of messy kitchens. The literal interpretation (actual home invasion) is obviously not meant seriously.
200,HUMOR It makes me so anxious lol ||| sameeee. Sometimes I wait till no one is online in my clan before I attack in war lmao,I always do that because I don’t want to be pressured,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a straightforward, genuine explanation of avoiding pressure during clan war attacks.

LeBron whispers “For the Purple and Gold” before shoving in the last dagger ||| Et tu, Lebron?","Hey man, it’s a game of thrones parody, not Shakespeare ",SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically corrects the commenter's reference to Shakespeare's 'Et tu, Brute?' by pretending not to understand it's a classical allusion being cleverly applied to the Game of Thrones parody context. The correction is unnecessarily pedantic and misses the obvious literary callback, which is the humorous intent."
202,"Vending machine at work made an error and distributed everything all at once. ||| Healthy, Wealthy, Wise... ""Let's fill it with chips""","But there's SUN Chips! They're healthy, right? ",SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses ironic questioning to mock the idea that Sun Chips are healthy, playing off Comment 2's sarcastic reference to filling vending machines with chips despite a 'healthy' motto. The rhetorical question with emphasis on 'healthy' indicates the speaker knows Sun Chips aren't actually healthy."
203,"Picture of culprit who brandished and fired gun at silently protesting student in Jamia while shouting, ""You want Azzadi? Ye lo Azaadi"". ||| This is the picture of a Terrorist, terrorizing students in front of a Delhi Police.","Oh, funny thing is he'll be out even before we know it.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses irony to criticize the justice system by sarcastically suggesting the perpetrator will face no consequences despite clear evidence of a serious crime. The speaker is expressing cynicism about judicial accountability rather than literally finding the situation funny.
204,"Accidentally commented in r/askwomen like a dumbass. I got this PM not too long after. ||| *My* intuition is telling me that this guy has a week's worth of Cheeto dust underneath his fingernails, but has an even grosser personality inside.

This is a sarcastic jab that plays on the ongoing insult about the person's size and fashion choices."
205,"Men of Reddit, what are somethings a mom should know while raising a boy? ||| You will not believe how much he'll eat as a teenager.",I read this as “You will not believe how much he’ll eat as a teenager”,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is simply quoting/repeating the previous comment verbatim, likely for emphasis or agreement. There is no ironic reversal or mocking tone present, making it a straightforward repetition rather than sarcasm."
206,I have a STEM PhD. And I earn six figures. ||| A PhD in *all* STEM fields?,See this is my question! Who doesn’t just say their field(s) of study?,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses rhetorical exasperation ('See this is my question!') to mock Comment 1's vagueness about their STEM field, implying frustration with the lack of specificity. The sarcastic tone questions why someone wouldn't provide more details rather than asking a genuine question."
207,Dame hits the game winner at the buzzer | TNT ||| OH MY GOD DAMIAN U CANT BE SERIOUS,Damn can’t remember the last time Dame hit a buzzer beater to advance in the playoffs ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses ironic understatement by claiming they 'can't remember' when Dame is famous for hitting playoff buzzer beaters, most notably the 2019 shot against OKC. This contradiction between the claimed forgetfulness and Dame's well-known reputation for clutch shots indicates sarcasm."
208,"Discussion The hypocrisy of this subreddit ||| I completely agree. All you hear is ""price sheets shouldn't exist"". Then people offer an ""overpay"" and people are like ""You know that *said item* is more than *other item*, so you shouldn't be offering that"". Figure yourselves out guys. ||| the price sheet should be in your head and obviously it should be the same for everybody, duh",ITT: 15 year olds argue over virtual game item economics.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses exaggeration and dismissal ('15 year olds') to mock the seriousness with which the thread participants are debating virtual item economics, implying their arguments are trivial or immature when the discussion actually involves valid points about consistency in trading practices."
209,"This athlete with celebral palsy deadlifted 200lb at 99lb ||| Wow good for him for really working hard to get to this point, but this is just reckless, shame on that trainer.

That is a life of unending pain",Don’t worry it’s okay! The trainer guy was watching him do this very unsafe thing *very* closely! It’s under control! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses exaggerated reassurance and italicized emphasis on 'very' to mock the safety concerns raised in Comment 2, sarcastically suggesting that close supervision makes an unsafe lifting form acceptable when the previous comment explicitly warned it's dangerous."
210,"Superstar German DJ ‘permanently banned’ from China for liking a ‘South Park’ tweet ||| People should be boycotting China, not sweating being banned. ||| People like their cheap goods too much. It’s inconvenient, they’d rather easier boycotts like Chick Fil A.",They are evil for donations years ago but I'm OK with my slave labor iphone ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,The response uses ironic self-contradiction to critique hypocrisy - condemning others for unethical practices while admitting to benefiting from the same unethical labor practices. The quotation marks and contrast between 'evil for donations' versus acceptance of 'slave labor' exemplify sarcastic criticism.
211,These Neith graphics really make the game look like a cheap mobile app. ||| Real talk why isn't Fafnir the guy trying to sell you chests? He wants the gold,That would actually make a shit ton of sense,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,The response is a genuine agreement that Fafnir (a dragon character obsessed with gold/treasure) would logically fit the role of promoting chest purchases in the game. The person is earnestly acknowledging the logic of the suggestion rather than mocking it.
212,"Ken Bone, the medias victim of the week, once posted this to a rape victim. This is the man the media chose to turn into a monster. ||| Why did they even start writing about this guy anyways? Because he asked a question during a debate? I'm not very versed in American politics. He seems like an overall normal and nice guy.",> Why did they even start writing about this guy anyways? Slow news day. ,SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a straightforward, literal answer to the question about why media covered Ken Bone. 'Slow news day' is a common, sincere explanation for why media outlets pursue celebrity gossip or minor stories, not an ironic reversal of meaning."
213,"A young poor kid offering a part of her meager meal to an elderly dog. I took this photo in one of the biggest temples in West Bengal. In the entire temple, this scene was the one of true devotion. ||| That’s why we say that every child is God like.",They possess the true good in this world still imo. Just need some nurturing.

The Saints just got screwed. Said as a Chiefs fan that is still sad.,The 2009 Vikings feel so bad for the Saints and their missed call in the NFCCCG. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses ironic personification (Vikings 'feeling bad') to sarcastically highlight that other teams have also suffered from controversial missed calls in championship games, implying the Saints shouldn't complain uniquely. It's a pointed comparison suggesting similar injustices have happened before."
216,"Senate defies Trump, passes historic resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen war ||| Is this the thread where donald supporters who support his idea to withdraw from Syria without a plan because we need to get out of the Middle East express their support of donald for vetoing this because we need to have a strong military presence in the Middle East? *edit* In regards to the inevitable ""Yeah well the leftists supported all these wars when Obama was in charge but are just against them now that is in charge!"" <URL> <URL> <URL> *edit2* Here's a picture of a kitten with a stuffed animal as eyebleach for those depressing graphs: <URL> ||| Those last three charts are so telling ||| They're the only three charts he posted unless I missed one?

This contradiction appears intentionally ironic/sarcastic, likely mocking the previous commenter's vague statement."

Amazingly, May was the most credible choice the last time.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response uses 'Amazingly' to suggest it's surprising that May was the 'most credible choice,' which is ironic given the context criticizing her decisions and coalition with the DUP. This suggests the opposite sentiment—that she was actually not credible at all."
218,Sexist comedienne gets owned over recent London terror attacks. ||| I'm sorry but...who is this Sofia Hagen? You say she's a comedienne but I've never heard of her nor seen her work.

The speaker is genuinely answering the question about who she is.
219,"Renee Young joins the Raw announce team full time ||| I like Renee as a backstage interviewer, honestly I don't really dig her as a commentator, she doesn't sound as enthusiastic or energetic. Last week she was kinda dull, and it was annoying as hell hearing her rave about Bella's",OMG HOW DARE YOU BESMIRCH QUEENS NAME! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses exaggerated outrage and theatrical language ('OMG HOW DARE YOU BESMIRCH QUEENS NAME') to mock the previous commenter's legitimate criticism, employing irony to ridicule their position rather than genuinely expressing offense."

They're really sticking it to those liberal snowflakes. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,The response uses exaggerated language ('really sticking it to those liberal snowflakes') and adopts the tone of Comment 3 in an over-the-top manner that appears to mock the logic of deliberately increasing the deficit as a political win. The enthusiasm seems insincere given the context of criticism about rising deficits.

This is sarcastic because it's treating his Oscar win as if it were an impossible, shocking event, when the context shows everyone genuinely happy for him."
223,Once a gooner always a gooner ||| I mean Chelsea also hate spurs. ||| Anyone with a brain and a heart hates Tottenham really. ||| And Chelsea fans too.,Why is it that everyone is amazing at making fun of Chelsea fans,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically frames Chelsea fans as 'amazing' at being made fun of, when the context shows multiple people are actually making fun of Tottenham. The speaker is ironically suggesting Chelsea fans are skilled at being ridiculed when they're not the primary target of the thread's jokes."

At least your ping didn't (gravity) spike, did it?",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses parenthetical puns ('ruin(ed)' and '(gravity) spike') to mock the escalating absurdity of complaints in the thread, suggesting these issues are actually fortunate rather than problematic, which is the opposite of what's being stated."
229,TIL that Japan has chosen Dragon Ball Zs Goku as an ambassador of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics ||| I hope they pronounce his name better than at the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade. They've had 2 chances now to get it right and both ended in not right. ||| How else can you pronounce it!?,Geeko like from the awesome live action movie ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically refers to the poorly-received live-action Dragon Ball Evolution movie as 'awesome' and uses a deliberately incorrect pronunciation 'Geeko,' mocking the thread's discussion about mispronunciation of Goku's name."
230,Miami Miracle ||| I regretted starting Kenyan Drake for 99% of this game ||| Drake is gud. Gase is a bitch.,"It’s almost as if Drake is a super electric athlete that needs more than 10 touches a game, but maybe that’s just me ",SARCASM,SARCASM,95,The phrase 'but maybe that's just me' combined with the understated 'It's almost as if' construction is used ironically to express an obvious criticism of Drake not getting enough touches. The speaker is sarcastically suggesting their opinion is uniquely insightful when it's clearly a straightforward complaint about poor coaching decisions.
231,"It’s not perfect, but I’m getting close. ||| Not perfect? Dude, I just slapped them back in there between the panel and pushed until I could close it ||| Same. I fear the day I have to open up my back panel of my tower.",Do it and then accept the added airflow of not having a back panel !! ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response suggests accepting a missing back panel as a benefit ('added airflow') when this would actually harm PC cooling and is clearly not desirable, which is ironic given the context of people struggling with proper panel installation."
232,"White House press secretary attacks media for accurately reporting inauguration crowds ||| I love how he in one breath talks about how people couldn't have accurate numbers because the park service hasn't reported them yet, then proceeds to give a precise method for estimating attendance.","The parks department is currently under audit. Once the audit is finished, he'll release the numbers. Trust me. ",SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response sarcastically suggests the parks department will release numbers after an audit, implying they never will. The phrase 'Trust me' combined with the implausible excuse mirrors the pattern of deflection criticized in the context, using irony to mock the lack of transparency."
233,"Hooray to Jennifer Aniston, whos turning 50 today. May she speak her childfree mind for another 50 years! ||| Why do I have to be mothering at all?? I have no problem with a societal obligation to take care of others (as in donate to charity, do volunteer work, something of that nature) but the specific obligation to be mothering? Nah, fuck that. ||| I'm mothering my cat very well, m'am. She's in a good state, soft and keeps me warm at night. ||| Mine's kinda bitey. I don't know where I went wrong!","My kitty farts on me, I know I failed him.",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The speaker is joking about 'failing' their cat because it farts on them, using exaggerated self-blame for a humorous pet quirk. The comment mirrors Comment 4's self-deprecating tone about pet ownership mishaps while describing an absurd situation."
234,Homophobic caucus goer finds out Pete is gay after committing to caucus for him ||| she judges Pete’s sexuality and then judges the volunteer for her “lack of faith”... how Christ-like of her,Don’t judge her. She is washed of sin and may cast the first stone. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response ironically inverts the Biblical principle that 'those without sin may cast the first stone' to mock the homophobic caucus goer's hypocrisy of judging others while claiming religious moral authority. The phrase 'washed of sin' sarcastically suggests she has no flaws, directly contradicting the critical context about her judgmental behavior."
235,"Snapchat: ""To attract more Android users, we are building a new version of our Android application from the ground up"" ||| Maybe they'll get rid of the extremely creepy snap map. Before anyone comments yes I know you can just disable it. But it shouldn't be a thing in the first place.",Yeah! Now I can finally know when my friends are all hanging out and I wasn't invited.  i promise i have friends,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response uses ironic exaggeration about the benefits of Snap Map tracking, then undermines itself with the self-deprecating admission 'i promise i have friends,' indicating the speaker is mocking the feature rather than genuinely endorsing it."
236,"#PepeIsHere | Nicolas Pepe becomes record signing ||| The name.. is Raul Sanllehi. I'm the two time, back to back, consecutive deals, transfer window champion. We're on a waterslide of success and all these small clubs are at the bottom in the kiddy pool, not knowing that a 4 foot 8 freak of nature is coming down the waterslide at 95MPH, naked, fully vasolined from head to tippy toe, ready to knock every single little club out. That's the difference between me and Gazidis. RRAAAAUULLLL!","We're at the Tippity Top and we're only halfway there. Tierney and CB, LETS GOOOOO",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response matches the enthusiastic, hyperbolic tone of the context comment and appears to genuinely celebrate Arsenal's transfer activity. It uses exclamation marks and excitement markers consistently with sincere support rather than mocking the sentiment."
237,Wanda: I lost everything. Also Wanda: ||| Most of the CGI budget was spent on removing Vision’s bulge. ||| I demand a director's cut with Vision's bulge left intact. And every other hero's as well. They could call it *Avengers: The Complete Package.*,Ryan Reynolds is making ten different phone calls right now.,NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response humorously implies Ryan Reynolds would be interested in the sexualized 'director's cut' idea, playing on his known comedic persona and frequent involvement in irreverent humor. The exaggeration of him making 'ten different phone calls' is a satirical way of suggesting he'd be enthusiastically pursuing this concept."
238,"All References to Climate Change Have Been Deleted From the White House Website ||| This is the only mention of the word ""climate"" on the site now. >President trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. URL ||| ""harmful and unecessary"" Bitch you tell me what's harmful when your trump tower is half sunk beneath the sea Climate change is the most harmful thing I could possibly think of at the moment. ||| Nuclear war has to be up there too.",We are going to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war by starting another nuclear arms race. ,SARCASM,SARCASM,95,"The response uses ironic contradiction by stating that reducing nuclear war likelihood will be achieved through starting a nuclear arms race, which are mutually exclusive outcomes. This contradictory pairing is clearly intended to mock a policy position rather than present a genuine argument."
239,"This is how I handle a creepy PM ||| When you get a *""Oo no""* as a response, you know you've done something right. You're an inspiration, OP.","It's the shortened form of ""I can't believe you've done this.""",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a straightforward, factual explanation of internet slang/meme culture, providing context for what 'Oo no' means. It's informative rather than ironic or mocking."
240,"What screams ""Im very insecure""? ||| Constantly wedging ""humble bragging"" into conversations. ||| I had a hard time with that when I was at Harvard.",Best example in this sub thread lol. A lot of the others are just straight bragging,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a straightforward criticism calling out Comment 3 as an example of humble bragging. The phrase 'Best example in this sub thread lol' is used literally to point out that Comment 3 demonstrates the behavior being discussed, not ironically."
241,"Donald Trump Played Central Role in Hush Payoffs to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal ||| Remember when American evangelicals wouldn't have supported a President who committed adultery with a porn star? ||| I'm 20 years old. No, I don't.","Rest assured, from an old dude...this used to be the case.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The response is a straightforward, sincere statement from someone older confirming that evangelical support for such behavior was indeed not the case historically. The phrase 'Rest assured' is genuine reassurance, not ironic or mocking."
242,"SERIOUS Would you reduce your meat consumption if lab-grown meat or meat alternatives were cheaper and tasted good? Why or why not? ||| Absolutely. Cow farts wreak havoc on the enviroment. ||| It’s actually the burps that make the most amount of methane. Farts too, but burps even more so.",Damn. We have to do something. Let's eat all the cows so they cant burp anymore ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response proposes an absurd solution (eating all cows) to prevent cow burps, which is logically contradictory and presented with exaggerated urgency ('Damn. We have to do something'). This hyperbolic reasoning is a classic sarcastic device used to mock the preceding environmental concern."
243,"Christ Pratt delivers a straight up sermon (in his own way) to thousands of cheering teens at the MTV movie awards. ||| You could tell a bunch of people got uncomfortable when he said ""They'll tell you you're perfect the way you are, but you're not"" Love Chris Pratt.",This is extremely hard for people to hear. It's the complete opposite of our culture and really offends people.,NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a sincere observation about how Chris Pratt's message contradicts modern cultural messaging and why it provokes negative reactions. The speaker is genuinely explaining why people found the statement uncomfortable, not mocking the sentiment."
244,"Super Bowl LII Post Game Thread: Philadelphia Eagles (16-3) at New England Patriots (15-4) ||| *2:20 left in the game. Patriots ball, down 5.* Me: We all know how this ends. *Tom Brady strip sack* Me: Oh. ||| Man I wasn’t comfortable until they actually brought the trophy out.","Even then I halfway expected Brady to come out of nowhere, grab the trophy and run away yelling ""no backsies.""",NOT_SARCASM,SARCASM,85,The response uses exaggeration and absurdist humor (Brady literally stealing the trophy and running away yelling 'no backsies') to mock the Patriots' legendary comebacks and Brady's clutch performances. The ridiculous image is not meant to be taken literally but rather to humorously emphasize how improbable the Eagles' victory felt given New England's history.
245,"Obsidian Says ""The Outer Worlds"" Will be Free of Microtransactions, Releases Screenshots ||| What engine is The Outer Worlds running?",Creation Engine because it allows them to build worlds quickly ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The Creation Engine is notoriously slow and cumbersome for world-building, making a claim that it 'allows them to build worlds quickly' ironic and sarcastic. This is a well-known criticism in gaming communities."
246,"Google announces Android 5.0 Lollipop ||| ""New handy controls like **flashlight**, hotspot, **screen rotation** and cast screen controls"". Finally. ||| I hope that you can customise which ones appear, not holding my breath but it would be great.","There were runours of just that, after parts of the code 'leaked'.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,92,"The response is a straightforward statement about rumors and leaked code regarding customization features. There is no ironic contrast, exaggeration, or mockery present. The speaker is sharing information directly related to the previous comment's hope for customization options."
247,Felony Charles Bennett lifts and slams Anthony McDavitt into the cage ||| Charles “fuck yo jiu jitsu” Bennett ||| The fact that this even happened in an MMA fight is incredible. Whirlwind lateral cage slam. I feel like I can say that will never happen again. Just another reason Felony deserves Goat status.,Another reason why fights should be on a basketball court ,SARCASM,SARCASM,85,"The response sarcastically suggests moving MMA fights to a basketball court, which is absurd given the context of praising an impressive cage slam. This is clearly mocking the idea by proposing an impractical alternative surface."
248,"Russia have qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup quarter finals. Spain eliminated ||| Man, thank god. Spain is so boring to watch. Tiki my taka.",Russia on the other hand were delightful ,SARCASM,SARCASM,92,"The response sarcastically agrees that Russia was 'delightful' to watch, which contradicts the implied criticism of boring football. This is ironic given Russia's relatively underwhelming style compared to Spain's technical play, and the sarcasm works as a counterpoint to the previous commenter's complaint about Spain."
249,Room full of white girls singing “My Ni$$a” while a black guy sits uncomfortably silent. ||| Why did she point at him with her thumbs. I swear there's a movie about this situation. ||| Like a Wayans brothers version of Get Out. ||| Reminds me more of the [rapping scene from Sorry to Bother You](<URL>,"The third act of STBY caught me so off guard. I can usually see things coming but man, i *really* didn’t see that coming",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,85,"The commenter is genuinely expressing surprise about an unexpected plot twist in 'Sorry to Bother You.' This is a straightforward, sincere statement about their viewing experience with no contradictory or mocking tone."
250,"Put the blame where it belongs ||| Adam Johnson is the host of a great podcast called [Citations Needed](<URL> about ""the media, power, PR, and the history of bullshit.""

Since listening, I pick up on instances of fetishized civility all the time.",NOT_SARCASM,NOT_SARCASM,95,The response is a genuine endorsement expressing agreement with the previous comments about the podcast episode. The speaker is earnestly sharing how the content has improved their media literacy by helping them identify patterns they previously missed.
